	<text>Washington Skating Pass.—Jackson Haines
gave an afternoon and evening exhibition of his
skill as a skater yesterday in the presence oflargo
and astonished crowds. His skill and agility on
skates are wonderful—way above and beyond any
thing ever before witnessed in this part of oor
country. When under fall headway, he seems to
ilyasbegocs over the ice. Then, every attitude
he assumes, every movement he makes, Is frill ot
grace and beauty* Bis form is the very perfection
of manly mould, and tho excellent taste he exer
cises In the matter of dress, is a feature worthy of
special commendation. A thoroughly trained
equilibrist and gymnast, every motion of his body
Is nnderhls most perfect control. He makes no
mistakcß,'nobltmders, except {or the amusement
ol the audience. Bis Imitation of a novice on
skates ore absurdly correct, and excite the most
boisterous laughter. Haines is a native of Now
York city. Several years ago, being a remarkably
skinful skater, by theadvice of friends, ho adopted
.it as a profession, and has 'continued to follow
it, summer and winter, with lucrative success. In
winter he plays star engagements upon the parks
in the States and the Canadas, and In the summer
performs his astonishing feats on parlor skates
upon the boards of the New York theatres. He is
acknowledged to bo without an equal, as a skater,
on the Western Hemisphere. He will continue to
display his skill at tho Washington Skating Park
dnnng the present week, where we recommend all
fb go and witness a “Wg thing on Ice.”
Oouzn Skating Pads.—The managers give a
grand Carnival, at the Ogden Park this evening,
and St wQI be sure to attract a crowd.
Central Skating Pass.—Champion skaters
arc Increasing In number. Following the example
ante Washington Skating Park, tho Central Park
announces a “champion” in the person of Captain
Robert Ballenllne, a sailor, who created much ex
citement on our river, three years ago,by hia grace
ful and wondcrfhl feats on skates. He will make
his first appeal arco this afternoon, and will also
be on band In thtf evening, when there will be a
fine display of fire works. Perhaps the champions
may be brought together in a friendly test of their
skill in the art which the god DUer inaugurated
forthe pleasure and gratification of his follow
ers.</text>

	<text>A SEATING SCENE.
Prinrea sml Pr I on tbe Ico
In St. petcrabnrtT.
On the evening of February 11th the
English Skating Club gave a fete at St.
Petersburg on tbe Neva. The grounds,
if one may apply such a word to several
acres of enclosed ice, are nearly oppo
site the English Church, and the club
had converted the usually unadorned
level of their winter freehold into an
Elysian field of ice temples, magnesium
lights, colored lamps, and fires, pavil
ions, and buffets. All round the en
closed space, writes the correspondent
of tbe London Times, were hung chains
of lantps, red and blue and green, fes
tooned in pretty patterns. At one side
was the royal pavilion, with a small
supper room behind, built on the ice.
Opposite to this were two kiosks for
military bands, while at either end of
the skating field were cloak and refresh
ment rooms for the general company.
In the center of the enclosure rose a
castle of frozen-water., a trophy of ice
masonry, converted into a chapolle ar
denteby a blaze of fires and lanterns
burning at its windows and battlements.
Small citadels were also built at the
corners of the enclosed space, their
mimic architecture flushed with Bangal
lights burning within; but the most
beautiful decoration of all was the soft
sunshine streaming from electric or
magnesium lamps fixed at' intervals
round the enclosure.
The Prince and Princess of Wales, the
Duke and Duchess ofEdiuburgh, Prince
Arthur, the Crown Prince of Denmark,
the Czarevitch, Czarevna, and the Grand
Dukes Vladimir and Alexis were pres
ent, and each and all entered heartily
into the skating, seeming thoroughly to
enjoy themselves. It was, indeed, a
welcome contrast and relief amid the
never-ending succession of balls and
dinners, which offer nothing half so
joyous as gliding to and fro over smooth
ice, to tbe sound of music, in the (lash
iag light of magnesium lanterns, and by
the rainbows of ten thousand colored
lamps. Then, also, one had the pleas
ure of seeing princes and princesses in
the flesh as it were, not sitting at high
tables or walking in marshalled pro
cessions, transfigured with stars and
ribands and jewels and long trains, and
taking their pleasure with the rest, as
ordinary mortals, onjoying no special
exemption even from collisions and
tumbles. The Grand Dukes are good
go-a bend skaters, very Jehus in their
furious driving of ladies' chairs, and the
Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edin
burgh, the Crown Prince of Denmark
and Prince Arthur, can bold their own
with the beat. The Princess of Wales
and Czarevna kept their skates on for a
very long time, and it was pretty to
watcn me Bisters gnuing aiong iiaim iu
band, or in a chair with three or four
gentlemen. Sometimes a ring would
form round the great American skater,
Mr. Jackson Haines, watching him exe
cute his marvellously dexterous and
graceful gyrations and gymnastics, ut
terly astonishing to the ordinary skater.
All the while the music played, and it
was near one o'clock before a crowd of
skaters gathered near the pavilion gave
a farewell cheer to the royal and impe
rial skaUrs.</text>

	<text>FIGURE SKATING NOW
ONE OF THE FINE ARTS
Best Exhibitions in World
: Are to Be Seen in
• .iNewYork
Skating has come to-be one of the;
fine arts. : While the records for speed
on th,e ice are perhaps most talked of,
the advance in fancy or figure skating
is quite as remarkable. The extent
to which .figure skating has been devel
oped, both at home, and abroad, .will
come as a surprise to most laymen In
such matters.. It is not generally
known. . again,. that the so called con
tinental style, .which is the standard in
all the great, skating . countries, is a
direct v outgrowth of the distinctively
American style, which was Introduced
into' Europe forty years ago. And, in
cidentally, probably the best skaters In
the world today, judged by the most
rigid rules, are: to be found in several
American cities.'-,
'America is today the only great skat-
Ing country in the world which Is not
regularly, represented in the Interna
tional skating union; This organization
at present: fixes the rules. for all com
petitive events, and it is under its
auspices that the great skating meets
are carried out. ;\u25a0 The official recogni
tion of American skill in skating
amounts to. nothing, however, since the
present standards for fancy skating the
world over are largely based upon
American standards. Any skillful
American skater, moreover, with a lit
tle practice, could readily acquaint him
self - with the rules as observed in
Europe. ,- c In point of fairness the ac
cepted standard in skating should
therefore, be called the international
style. - v. " '...-.
The present standards of figure skat-
Ing ; werei established by an American
ii a n C « SO tK lneS| In fiur °Pe. a trifle
more J.han forty years ago. j .Since his
time there have grown up the so called
Austrian, : Swedish and Russian schools
but fl fSht B Sri a fu whlch are - * fter h
Within the last fe-w years the same
general methods have been adopted ' in
•England,, so that this style, originally
American,.. may be accepted as truly
international. In each" country during
the last forty years, since the introduc
tion, of American methods into Eu
rope there has been more or less orig
inal development. : \ --
Since the year 1891 there has been an
annual meet, which has been attended
by \u0084the ? representatives of the great
skating countries of Europe. . which "
naturally .the great : event of its kind
forskate»s-the world over. For s«v
fh^TT 76 .^ 2? Americ 5 n - whether from
the United States; or Canada, has quali
fied for an international competition of
figure/ skating: •. Meanwhile in the
United States many, distinctive tricks
or methods of skating have been de
yeloped. ilt is safe :to say that
American skaters ; are' the best in the
world, it. is ; none the less Interesting
to 5 note ; what Europeans have been
doing:-, with the American style in the
last few years.
J The claim -that some of the best

skater.^no *friatte"r3what;Jiisiindividual
style.^will fdoj well>'to,fstudy.v~- For"; the
beginner.^ these "<•\u25a0 laws \u25a0 are the correct
grammar . of skating. These general
rules have been laid down by Georgs
H. Browne, •A. M. The questions of
correct carriage and movement are
very ' definite. The best authorities hold
that the body while skating should be
held upright, should not be bent at the
hips but should be held at all times
without stiffness. The bend of the
knee or body should only be mo
mentary. The head should be held up- •
right. - .
Again, . in skating the unemployed
foot should be held only a little way
from the ice and should never be
dragged behind. . The toe should be
turned downward and outward. Th«
knee should be only slightly bent and
generally held behind the unemployed
foot, but should always be awunjc
freely, so* as to assist the general
movement, but without at any tim«
being held fax out in any direction.
Many skaters of real talent make a
mistake in so simple a matter as the
position of the arms. The arms should
hang down easily, but without stiff?
ness.
• They may be used like the unem
ployed foot, to assist the movement of
the body, but the elbow and hand
should be kept near the body and ex
cept in rare instances the hands should
not be raised above the waist line.
The fingers should be neither spread
nor clinched.' but held In a natural
position. The aim 1 should be to avoid
everything; violent or> angular and the
impression; should be given that one is
skating without effort.
In the tournaments held under th«
rules of. the European clubs -there Is
no precise standard for the size of , the
figures skated. The size of th« figures
cut or. the ice should be adapted to tho.
size and build of the skater. The tend
ency to skate large figures Is discour
aged because such skating tends to In
stability; a slowing of the pace and
awkwardness of carriage. The idea is
to make the manner of execution more
Important Jthan the mere cutting of
beautiful prints on the Ice.' Good form
consists In unbroken, rhythmic transi
tion. * *
:, The figure skater Is first Instructed
In a series of prescribed exercises
which are known under the rules as
compulsory, figures. , These consist of a
series'" of simple curves, growing more
complicated as the skater progresses.
When 1 these preliminaries have been
mastered the skater graduates into the
class where free skating.' as it is named.
Is permitted— that is. .the skating of
optional figures and for a specified
length, of time.
".The compulsory figures may be called
the " grammar ' of . skating. . The free
skating, to , continue the 'figure. Is th»
rhetoric of ''the art of figure skating.
The compulsory figures. In other worda.
comprise, a series of curves, the com
bination of simple lines so selected that
each illustrates - a distinctive i trick ;In
skating. ; It Is the combination of theso"
various \u25a0'\u25a0 curves , that ,- forms > the com
plicated figures of the so called fre*
skating grbups. In any regular tour
nament the contestants are required to
skate six of . these compulsory figures.
Every .compulsory figure again ... must
be'eommenced from rest— that is. only
a single strike of the other foot. The
change from one foot to the othermust
be -made without 'pause and with a
single" stroke.; Every figure again must
bei repeated three times, both on the
rightfand on the left foot, the repeti
tion to follow .without pause/..
" The free[skating .which follows under
the; rules must comprise attractive and
graceful -j figures which will -~ arrange
themselves • into : a coherent unit. *] Ther*
should |be "a .continuous" swing without
breaks s or* awkwardness of ~any ! kind;

	<text>A,L
HEALTHY revival of interest in
one of the greatest of winter
sports, ice skating, has been
brought about by the cessa
tion of hostilities between the different
unions that govern this sport this sea*
son. The action of the International
Bkating union, which controls the sport
in Canada and In the United States, in
taking away the charter of the old
Eastern Amateur Skating association
has been heartily Indorsed.
As a result of the renewed Interest
many, clubs throughout the country
have become very active and more
races have been skated at the various
links than ever before.
While loe skate racing ts gaining In
popularity every year, figure skating
has become almost a lost art In Ameri
ca, but there is a movement on foot
to stimulate renewed interest in expert
figure-skating, whose devotees have
/become fewer and fewer In recent
v-'years. It is proposed to Introduce a
^system known as the international
style, which has grown so popular
'f among the enthusiasts abroad that
if there is now a generally accepted
standard of. competition throughout the
European continent and the British
Isles. Countless organisations through
out Europe foster the sport, and a sur
prlslrigly large number of contests of
national and international character
are held in the season.
Abroad very little racing is done on
skates, but figure experts can be seen
daily by the hundreds on the various
outdoor rinks. The International Skat
tag union announced the location and
dates for the union's championships
this year recently. The figure cham
pionship of the world was fixed for
championship was set for Vienna Feb.
1, while St. Petecsburg gets the cham
pionship of Europe title for Feb. 25 and
26. The speed championship of Europe
will be at Hamar Feb. 18 and 19, with
the world's speed championship at
Dronthelm, Feb. 25 and 26.
Figure 8kating.
Many people consider all skaters as
one class of athletes. They know too
little of the vast difference between the
methods of the speed expert and those
of the figure star and work on the the
ory that the racing man must also be
an able executed of rancy strokes, sim
ply because he is proficient- in track
contests, and vice versa. Nothing could
be more fallacious. Tou might as well
believe a billiard champion to be a for
midable pool player through the fact
that he understands the use of a cue.
Figure and speed skating are separate
arts, Just as billiards is in nowise simi
lar to pool.
1
The figure skater is more of what
might be termed an artist than is the
speed, performer. He is credited in
competitions for the carriage and bal
ance of his body, the facility with
which he cuts figures, the accuracy of
his strokes, etc. His racing brother, on
the contrary, wins by crossing the fin
ish line first. Irrespective of the tech
nical perfection of his stroke or the de
gree of development toward the mastery
et,..what, ponetUutes good form. Of
fibu*s« the carefully trained, scientific
racer economizes in strength and wind
by following approved and hence im
proved methods, but his glory and gold
medals are the rewards of strength,
speed and endurance more than skill.
The beginner in figure skating finds
the approach to this fascinating pas
time hedged by difficulties. Unless
he is determined to succeed he will
never rise above mediocrity, which
condition every right minded person
should abhor in any branch of en
deavor. First the beginner must learn
what to do, next how to do it and
than how to do It perfectly. Lastly
be must practice faithfully, bo that hi*
muscles will receive ntctatry train*
int. that hip balance and polae will be
Improved and his knowledge of flfurei
made comprehensive. One figure leads
to another, just as arithmetic paves
the way tor algebra and geometry in
school. Simple strokes graduate into
the combinations, and these in turn
merge into the complex. Only he that
baa a trustworthy knowledge of the
skating alphabet will force himself In
to the highen circles of competition
and accomplishment Therefore take
time by the forelock and build.your
reputation on,a firm foundation.
"Imitate tlui leaders" I* the rule laid
down for beginners in many lines of
ahtletlcs, and to some extent It Is a
good one tor ambitious figure skaters.
Single out some expert and watchhlm
so closely that he may suspect you of
being a detective on his track, tyit do
not sacrifice your own individuality In
your style.

CE skating has more ele

I any other sport known to
mankind. It is popular
among a larger number
of people probably than
any other sport in the
world. It, may be learned in extreme
youth and it retains far into old age the
wonderful potency of its fascination. It
makes for strong, supple muscles, expand
ed lungs, graceful bearing, quickened eye.
zcstful appetite and restful sleep. In its
best form, known only to the persevering
student, it is as .ntneate as a game of
chef, appealing as thoroughly to the
trained mind as to the disciplined muscles.
The very fact that the sport is difficult
partly explains its attraction, for in sports,
as in other things that which is easy
loses its interest. Probably in no other
pastime known to the world are there so
few real champions, and therefore so
much room for the ambitious seeker after
leadership
Once Leaders of Sport.
Surely the Tjnited States, the greatest
outdoor nation of history, ought to lead
in this the greatest outdoor pastime in
fhe world We did once And it is
planned that we shall again. Here are
the plans
Jackson Haines, the finest exponent of
artistic and daring figure skating pro
duced by the United States during the
nineteenth century, went to Europe in
1S64 and became the sensation of every
skating centre It is historically true
that this American skater was the father
of the present developed style of figure
skatinc used on the Continent He
made exhibitions before all the crowned
heads of Northern Europe, children,
rinks, skating figures and other things
were named after him, and so remark
ably successful was his tour that he re
mained there until his death. He lies
buried in a little village of Finland, and
his monument, erected by the peasants,
hrars the interesting inscription: "Jack
son Haines, the American Skating King.
Then, having taught the world how to
do the thing, we ceased practising it our
selves, and drifted from leadership to the
foot of the class. During the last quar
ter of a century no American amateur
dared show himself in the contests of
Europe. Our skating would have drawn
roars of derision in any skating centre of
the world We were utterly discredited
in the field which was once ours without
the trouble of competition. It was a
curious situation.
Chief among the causes of this condi
tion was the stupid retention of rules long
outgrown. Every athletic authority
knows the necessity for constant revision
of the rules to meet developments in the
game. But for twenty years a little
coterie of veterans, self appointed cus
todians of the sport, insisted upon retain
ing a mossbacked and barnacled cham
pionship programme. Good as it might
have been when it was originated in 1S60
after Haines startled all Europe with his
work, the American has gone abroad who
knew enough about skating to analyze
skating secrets, and from a study of the
skating styles of all the northern nations
of Europe has discovered that they are
even to-day using the same movements.

Mr. O. B. Haycock, of Ottawa, promi
nent in the MInto Skating Club and part
ner of Lady Evelyn Grey in skating ex
hibitions in Canada and at the Arena in
Boston last winter, will probably become
one of the vice presidents of the club.
Miss E. Kingford and Mr. Phillip Chrys

and Mr. Haycock compose the famous

Identical pattern of skate which Haines
introduced. So bsck to the old home
comes the lost art, safe in the custody
of one who treasures it with the en
thusiasm of the man with a hobby, and
with it the scheme for the founding of an
international organization which shall
maintain the traditions of the past as well
as meet the advances of the future. In
stead of being jealous of the American
scheme, the world of skaters recognizes
the right of Jackson Haines' countrymen
to be leaders m a plan to bring together
the best skaters and the best skating
styles of the world.
American Styles.
There remains, however, this interest
ing difference, that while Jackson Haines
received scant recognition from the social
leaders of his day, the present revival
of the new international style of skating
has the advantage of exponents and ad
vocates of the highest social prominence
here and abroad. Then, too, Haines was
a professional, while those who are at
the front of this new movement have
the additional prestige of amateurs, giv
ing their services as a labor of love.
The style of skating which may be
called nationally American, to contrast
It with the Continental or international
style, is familiar to every frequenter of
our rinks or frozen ponds. Soon after
the beginner has learned the threes and
a feW backward steps., he begins to do
figure movements of eights, on one or
both feet, with loops, bracket', anvils,
Maltese crosses, ic. The fault with our
skating, and the thing which It is pro
posed to remedy, is that wc skate all our
figures much too small, too rapidly, and
that we are careless in the carnage of
the arms and the body. We have a re
strained pose entirely out of keeping with
the freedom characteristic of this beau
tiful form of motion
We have long been accused of being
"barrel bead" skaters, that is, of pre
ferring to do our intricate figures in a
tiny circle no bigger than the head of a
barrel. It must be clear even to the
superficial obserrcr that this form of skat
ing is far removed from what graceful
skating ought to be. And added to the
smaiincss oi inc usures mere is asso
ciated a speed which makes them utterly
Incomprehensible. It was for many years

Even before Mr. Irving Brokaw, of New
York, one of the younger leaders in so
ciety and athletics, won the American
amateur skating championship, he was
recognized as the most graceful skater
of championship calibre America had pro
duced in decades. But he was no medsl
hunter. The history and the philosophy
of the sport attracted him and he began
collecting data. The result was bis su

With ample leisure to indulge his hobby
and with cosmopolitan tastes, Mr. Brokaw
soon became welcome among the famous
skating resorts of Europe, where the
name of Jackson Haines is by no means
forgotten. He recognized the deficiencies
of the cramped American style and em
ployed Herr Bror Meyer, the Swedish

Irving Brokaw, assisted by a coterie of
society folk fond of the sport, debnite
work has already been done. There are
rooms reserved for the club in which the

the Ice so that the correct position can be
obtained by study of the glass. This
latter feature, while familiar to the pa
trons of the best rinks of Europe, hss
never before been employed in this coun
try. By the International Skating Club local
competitions are to be encouraged, and
there will be a national contest for the
selection of national champions. Through
the efforts of those who are Interested in

Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Syers, of London,
have all been heard from and are in sym
pathy with the plans. It is possible that
quite a coterie of famous foreign skaters
may be seen here another winter.
Fancy dancing, which has been enjoy
ing such a furore during the present win
ter among society folk, has been taken
up by the figure skating fraternity and
bids fair to be a distinct find in the field
of sport. Jackson Haines himself was
a famous dancer and many of his move
ments were executed to dance music. The
best waltzer on skates in the world is
probably Miss Muriel Harrison, of the
Princes Rink, London, who has herself
originated several new waltz steps ac
cepted by the experts.
As to skates, the best experts in the
world are now using almost the idebtical
model which Jackson Haines introduced
into Europe fifty years ago. It should
be round toed that is, the skate blade
should be carried forward and curled
over toward the toes. But it should not
touch the toes, nor should it he attached
to the front of the footplate. On this
forward curt there should be deep cor
rugations for toe spins and -pirouettes.
The only skater of prominence who does
not use this skate is Grenadier, the Eng
lishman, and he has a style peculiar to
himself.
The Correct Skate.
The skate should have but two stanch
ions or uprights from blade to footplate.
The toeplate should never be fastened to
the shoe at its front edge, but at or back
of the ball of the foot, allowing ample
freedom for the action of the toes. The
power of the stroke, or what might be
termed the thrust, should come from the
ball of the foot. These are the explana
tions of the undoubted easier and faster
running of the new skating equipment.
and they have been accepted everywhere.
Mr. Brokaw may be said to have discov
ered them. As to the width of the blade
of the skate there is some difference of
opinion, the preference being for about
a quarter inch blade. The radius should
be about nine feet, that is the curve of
the blade, carried out, would make a circle
nine feet in diameter. The skate de
scribed is now being made in this coun
try. It is appropriate after all these
years that we should be supplying the
world with the skate which revolution
ized skating.
The shoes for skating should be firmly-
snug around the heel and allow ample
freedom for the movement of the toes
while lying firm over the instep. They
should curve In just above the back of
the heel so as to fit the foot when the
leg is bent slightly at the knee, which
is the customary position for figure move
ments. As to height, there is general
agreement that ten inches is about right,
since the free use of the muscles of the
calf and leg should not be interfered with
and the full strength of the heavy ankl
muscles should be available if needed.
In the matter of clothing, freedom is
the one essential. The foreign men skat
ers all use the tight fitting jersey costume,
which is sung and yet elastic, but our
skaters feel a bit too professional in such
a rig. Knickerbockers or riding breeches
are desirable and a soft, black leather
legging is regarded as more correct than
the henry black pigskin puttee.
Interest in winter sports grows apace.

"In 1861," he added, "when the ball
went tip in -November, we had sixty-three
daya skating, the next best record of
fifty-three daya being In 1808-80. During
tho laat four years tho fluctuations havo
been like this: In tho wintor or 1008-09 the

were twenty-four days skating; last win

a probable forty-ftve or fifty this winter.
The first .Sunday of this month 30.000
persons sKaiea on tno (.entrai l-arn lases,

At a big retail store devoted exclu

for a week or more the firm had been
hardly, able to get ice skates fast enough
to meet the demands of customers, the
usual stock having boen sold out soon
after the beginning or the big freeze.
This la not all: Twice as many women
as usual are learning to skate this winter,
an instructor said, and more women than
men, speaking generally, are excelling In
(ancy skating, having more time to prac
tise and usually learning more easily.
The other day, for Instance, a small
woman at the rink who excited Interest

up entirely. I decided about two weeks
ago that I should like to know the feel of a
pair of skates again, though 1 felt almost
afraid to try. But it seems that one never
forgets how to skate, and now I am tak
ing Icsrons In fancy skating."
The earlier the .better la a good rule to
apply to learning to skate, nevertheless
women far past their salad days are
putting on skates for the first time this
winter, and the number of almost elderly
women seen atilndoor skating places is
astonishing. Collectively, the enthusiasts
admit, these rare conditions have been
Immensely favorable to the cause of fancy
skating.
Before explaining that the Continental
variety alma to make an art or fancy
skating and to replace the go as you please
style of Jerky, restricted movements with
larger, freer strokeswhlchmake for grace
rather than speed instructors usually
make it plain that after all to America
belongs the distinction of originating the
Continental style of skating and that the
only reason Europe got to practising this
first was that half a century ago Ameri
cans probably deserved the criticism that
they were not lovers of out door sports.
Had It been otherwise America never
would havo allowed Jackson Haines, the
originator of daring and really beautiful
figure skating, to leave his own country
in 1808 for lack of patronage, to be re
ceived with acclaim all over Europe.
And had women taken the same Interest
In outdoor sports then that they take
now it might not havo happened nnyway.
Mc. Haines was handicapped by tho Tact
that ho won a professional who Incidentally
had a certain make of skate he wanted to
get on tho market. But for this his bones
might have boen resting, now in America
instead of in a Finland cemetery, under
a monument erected by admiring natives
and inscribed "The American Skating
King." Fortunately for" the relntroduo
tion here of tho stylo of skating originated
by Haines, its most active sponsors are
amateurs with no personal ends to serve
who are indifferent even to capturing
medals. What concerns them most Is
the painful truth that until very recently
no American amateur haa dared to ap
pear in European contests.
Mr. Irving Brokaw, head enthusiast
and who, having leisure and money to
indulge in his favorite sport took lessons
or the best professionals in Europe said
that our skating would have been laughed
at in any skating centre of Europe and
that Americans were in the curious posi
tion or being discredited in a sport which
once belonged to them wlthout.the need
of competition.
To make a break in the listing order
of things Mr. Brokaw entered an amateur
competition at St. Moritz, Switzerland,
and captured a prize, the first ever taken
by an American for skating in Continental
style. Since then Mr. Brokaw haa been
invited to take port in the world's cham
pionships held in Manchester, England,
this month, the first invitation of the kind
received by an American. It is not too
much to expect that before long America
will be able to furnish both men and
women amateurs in plenty able to com
pete for the world's championships.
On this point Mr. Brokaw said:
"I look for a wonderful development
in figure skating over here in the next
two years. It is evident, I think, that
the Continental movements will become
immensely popular and that grace, ease
and beauty will soon bo leading charac
teristics of American as well as or European
skating. The theory or the art haa been
reduced to such a practical basis that boys
and girls, men and women may learn
to skate from printed instructions. To
learn figure skating one must devote hfin
seir to figure skating. There Is a special
figure skate, curved on the bottom so as
to make curves and circles entirely possi
ble. It is round toed, and on this forward
url are deep corrugations for too spins
Praotlcally thla model, used by fancy
skatera the world over, Is identical with
that Introduced by Jackson Halnea to
Europo fifty years ago.
"Ono of tho principal features of figure
skating," Mr. Brokaw continued, "Is the
curve. To be able to control the circles
means that ono has gained the power
to maintain the body In graceful atti
tudes. Every ono should skate large Jig'
ures first.
Tho International style is free, un
cramped and artistic, after the manner
of the Hubs ion dancers. In teaching this
instructors insist that the head shall be
erect, the eves seldom or never on the ioe,
the bodr held upright, not bent forward
or sideways from the hips; shoulders back
chest expanded. The arms, active or
passive, should have free play from the
shoulders, the elbows slightly bent, the
hands held with palms downward or
Inward. Speed Is not a feature of the

The old American method pay Uttle
attention to position. A skater may do
anything ho likes with his arms. The
strictly Ennliah style of skating, while
more uniform. Is about as ungraceful.

of whom axe Mrs. Harry La Montague,
Miss de Coppet and Ellis Hoffman, one
would say that ballet dancing is easy
compared with tns new figure skating
on Ice.
Besides walUlnff and standing on their
toes, these skaters hop, skip, jump and
twirl while skimming over the ice as
eraoefully as birds. According to a
Canadian professional there are 1,100
different figures to Continental skating.
How many of these New lorkers nave
mastered no one knows, but among the
wonderful figures which may be called
almoet popular now a re the swallow and
the sea gull, the ten step, the Choctaw
Indian, the spread eagle watte, tho spiral.
the rocker turn, the corkscrew spin, the
split toe, the opera swing, the tandem
glide. To name them is easy enough;
to give any idea of how they are done Is
almost Impossible. The walte, which
except ror a longer glide, is much like
.he average ballroom waltz and Is callod
an easy figure, is one of tho most popular
To prove how thoroughly In earnest
the amateur promoters or Continental
figure skating in America are, an Inter
national Skating Club was organized
last weok under tho direction of Mr.
Brokaw with headquarters at tho St.
Nicholas rink and a membership of fifty,
comprising soma of tho beet amatourn
hero and in Boston, tho lattor city bulng
quite as onthuslastlo as Now York over
tho now stylo fancy skating.
Said Mr. Brokaw: "For some tlmo
tentatiro plans have been under con
sideration for the formation of such a
club, and when It was seen tit-it tho Interest
excited by tho introduction of Continental
ngiiro skating over, hero was taking root
instead of dying out, some of us went
uhead and organized a club whose main
purpose will be to encourage local nnd
national amateur competitions. From
all over this country nnd from Europe
have come to mo expressions of Interest
in (he club. Canada too says It wants
to be represented. Mr. Haycock, who
often takes part with Lady Evelyn Grey
in Canadian skating' competitions, is to
be enrolled us a member. From London
comes word that the Duko and Duchess
of Bedford, tho former president of tho
Figure Skating Club of London, are much
Interested In tho aims of tho International
Skating Club, as uro also Mr. and Mrs
Edgar Myers, Mrs. Syers being tho cliani'
Dion woman skater of huioiw. I ho club
proposes to organize the skaters and have
clulis in various localities.
"The International Skating Club of Eu
rope includes in Its membership repre
sentatives from all the skating countries
except America. At the headquarters
in St. Nicholas Itlnk there will be u room
fitted with lockers for the use of members.
Tho latest foreign periodicals devoid
to ico sports will bo kept on Hie; tO"
will bo bulletins announcing skating com
petitions and c.irnl vow, and phologrnplis
of famous skaters. The equipment will
include also a hugo portable mirror which
may bo moved to the sido of tho lee so
that correct positions can be studied by
critical skaters. This feature is not
new in Europo but it has never before
boon used over here.
Tho Philadelphia Skating Club, organ
ized In 1810, was, I believe, the flrot of
tho kind in this country, or at least the
first of any Importanco, nnd Philadelphia
is taking almost us much interest aa Uos

ciety is practising the Continental style
of skating more generally, I think, than

and the modern school of ballet dancing on the
Ice. The latter style of skating Is exactly the
same as the ballet dancing on the Boor, and tbe
training for it is similar to the work of the bal
let dancer. It consists of tricks, and everything
is done for effect. Pantomime Is introduced,
and the arms and legs are employed regardless
Of the rules and Ideas of strict sMirt.
"A very fine example of the European ballet
on Ice Is to be seen at the Hippodrome, Char
lotte Is probably the best of her kind. But how
many amateurs would care to skate In this
manner?
"It needs training from early childhood, and
Is only useful for professional exhibitions. It
Is the same as ballet dancing and modern danc
ing the difference, for Instance, between a
toe dancer and Mrs. Vernon Castle.
"To the sNirtsman or woman, form must
naturally mean more than tricks and acrobatics.
It Is far better to execute the simplest edge in
the correct International manner than to per
forin a so-called 'stunt,' which to the experienced
skater really means nothing.
"The best teachers and first class profes
sionals In Kurope (which is the home of the
new school i skate in strict form and do not
advocate any other than the simple Continental
school. That docs not mean that spins, pirou

"Many people do not know the difference In
the school of skating, and I have not tbe
time to explain it, but before continuing I
would like to say that the American style con
sists of grapevines, twists, and their figures are
mostly executed in a tiny apace on two feet.
These figures are entirely out of date and as
old fashioned as the barn dance. The best
American skaters have adopted the Continental
method, and Irving Brokaw has done n great
deal to belp the sport and tbe International
style.
"Tbe latter method excludes all violent, ugly,
angular or stiff action and gives the skater a

	<text>Fashionable Society Now Busy with 6 6Ice Teas99 and
((Dansants a Glace99 and Not Enough Skating
Rinks or Instructors to Meet the Demand
ICE skating, or rather dancing on
Bkates. Is the newest fashionable
amusement. There is every indica
tion that the new craze, which already
is country-wide In extent, will be taken
tup by people of all ages, and In all
walks of life, with the same <>tithuBlasm
that has converted men, women and
children into fox-trotters and tango-ex
perts during the past three or four sea
sons.
Skating on ice is considerably more
difficult for adults to learn than dancing
Dancing on the ice is a feat which only
export skaters dare to tackle. Never
theless, the difficulties of the new fad
Beem to have had little effect on Us
popularity, and the rlnkB throughout the
country are now crowded morning, noon
and night with debutantes and society
matrons who are determined to become
expert skaters and Ice-dancers In the
shortest possible time.
The dauceB which expert skaters are
able to execute on the ice Include the
old-fashioned waltz, the ten-step, another
form of waltc, the fox-trot and various
modifications of the other dances which
have become popular in recent seasons.
While these ice-dances look extremely
difficult to perform, the accomplishment
follows easily enough after the funda
mental figures of figure-skating ha\o
been acquired. A good figure-skater can
learn new figures with as much facility
as a dancer learnB new steps. The miin
thing that is necessary is to become
adept at ordinary figure-skating. Danc
ing on Ice will then follow easily r-noueh,
although, of course, it will require a good
deal of practise.
The foundation of all figure-skating is
the ability to use the four edges of the
skates?the Inside left, the outside left,
the inside ri?ht and the outside right,
and to be able to skate backward on
either of these edges Just as readily as
forward. Dally practise on these funda
mentals is essential to progress in ice
dancing.
The fact that the new amusement has
already taken a firm hold is evidenced
In many ways Four of New York's
most fashionable hotels have already
planned ice rinks ;"or the use of their
patrons. The Hill more is the first to
open Its rink to the public. The Wal
dorf is 6aid to be investing in the
neighborhood of a million dollars in
rink on the roof of its new annex. The
Hotel Astor and the McAlpin are now
arranging similar facilities. Some of the
rostaurantB and cabarets which have
hitherto made their dancing-floors their
principal attraction are preparing to sub
stitute ice for hard-wood so that those
who havt danced may hereafter skate
instead.
Most significant of all. perhap-. is the
thorough manner in which New York,
Boston and Chicago society has taken
the lead in adopting the new fad. In
New York, a club was formed several
weeks ago by enthusiasts and its mem
bership includes most of the debutantes
of the season, the girls who are to come
out next year and some young married
people. Among subscribers to the club
are Mrs. John .lacob A&tor, Mr. and Mrs.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, Mr. and Mrs. Ed
win Gould. Mr. and Mrs. Irving I3rokaw
and a host of others whose names are
Terv well known In the most exclusive
social circles.
ThiB club has engased the St. Nicholas
Skating Rink for .Monday afternoons for
the entire season, which lasts until the
end of April. Professional skaters and
Instructors have been engaeed to In
struct the members in the intricacies of
Ice-dancing.
In Boston, expert Bkaters have been
engaged by the Boston Skating Club, an
exclusive organization, to teach society
the new fad. Mr. and Mrs. A. Windsor
Wills. Miss Eleanora Soars and Miss
Edith Rotch are. perhaps, the most promi
nent of Back Bay fashionables who are
leading the movement In New England.
In Chicago, the Sherman House some
time ago anticipated the present craze
and installed a skating-rink In the Col
lege Inn, In the basement, in place of the
dancing floor. Tt was foreseen that danc
ing was losing its hold and that ic.e-skat
inz was Koing to take its place. The
change has met with great success.
That the general public Is goine: to
follow society's lead and make skating
the principal diversion this Winter Is in
dicated plainly bv the unusually large
number of people who have already
taken up the snort at the rinks.
At St. Nicholas Rink, for Instance, rec
cord crowds have Ifeen in attendance at
every session since the opening of the
season on November 1. Thir. rink ac
commodates S00 people on the Ice at a
time and there are three sessions a day.
Men and women of all aees arc clamor
ing for instruction or for a chance to
practise and perfect themselves in the
new skating dances
The same situation ,prevails at the
other rinks throughout the country.
There are two large rinks on the Const,
one at Seattle and the other at Portland.
Both are dolnn a record business, and
similar enthusiasm is evident in Detroit.
Cleveland. Pittsburgh, and Chicago. *
The new amusement will not score its
greatest triumph, perhaps, until freez
ing weather arrives, when the limited
capacity of the indoor rinks will be
augments^ by the unlimited facilities
of the park lakes, BtreamH
and out-door rinks. Then.
of courBe, there will be
sufficient outlet for all the
pent-up enthusiasm which the
craze 1b hound to arouse in
the meantime.
Evidently that is what the
manufacturers of sporting
goods und apparel are relying
upon mainly, for although the
indoor skating season is now
a month or two old, the large
skate factories are still run
ning on a twenty-four hour
schedule in three shifts in an
effort to cope with the tre
mendous demand for skates
which they are confident will
materialize within the next
two or three months.
Up-to-date skating has brougnt with it
Its own special styles of wearing ap
parel. All the costume makers and
manufacturers of wearing apparel have
vied with each other in getting out at
tractive skating designs and the big re
tail stores have given considerable spate
in their advertising to the beautiful
creations which have been made avail
able for followers of the new c^aze. Thi<*
factor, in itself, it is believed, will insure
the popularity of ire-dancing. Indeed, it
has been suggested that women may be
tempted to take up skating in order to
wear the new garments rather than to
purchase the new garments for the sake
of skating.
in liiiQ with this phase of the situation,
a series of weekl> fashion shows de
voted to garments specially designed for
skating has been arranged at the St.
Nicholas Rink. Already several of the
well known women'* specialty houses
have exhibited their models at these dis
plays. and the remarkably effective cos
tumes which skating has developed are
certainly not calculated to deter women
irom lulling into hue.
The social opportunities wiiich the
new craze affords are considerable. Al
ready two elaborate Ice-Teas or "dan
sauts a glace" have been given by Mr.
and Mrs. Irving Brokaw, in which the
skating stage of the Hippodrome was
engaged.
On these occasions, the guests of the
Brokaws to the number of about 100
participated in the general ice-dancing
and were then entertained by Mr.
Brokaw. probably the most accomplished
amateur figure-skater In the world.

present, bringing with them Mr .and

.lust how tho now era'/'1 startrd :io
one is able (l?'iinitely to explain. Per
haps the largest single factor it> arous
ing interest in skating, however, has
heen the wonderful exhibition given by
Charlotte and her associates at the
Hippodrome. The Ballet on Ice was
brought from the Admiralpalast, at lb-r
liu, by Mr. Dillingham and has been uni
versally admired. The Shuberts have
helped to foster Interest in the new
diversion by converting the "Castles in
the Air" cabaret, on top of the Forty
fourth Street Theatre, into an Ire Palace,
where every evening a skating troupe dis
plays its skill on real ice.
Particularly significant is tho fact that
some of the most accomplished of the
professional dangers who have hitherto
been featured at the Hroadwuj cabarets,
sensing the drift of things, have taken
up dancing on ice and are not only giv
ing exhibitions but instruction.
Kiloen Molyneux and Clifton Webb, of
the Town Topics Company, for instance,
who made such a hit as professional
dancers, have shown equal skill at fox
trotting on skates in the rinks. Norvel
Hnprie and Isabel Mutler, at the Castles
in the Air. have similarly forsaken the
old-style hardwood dancing for the more
graceful and more diflii-uit feat of ice
dancing.
Preparations to accommodate tho thou
sands of skate-mad enthusiasts who will
bo clamoring for a chunco to display
their skill, or lack of it. as soon as the
first freezing weather sets in. have been
Kathleen Pope and George Kerner
made at the various public tennis courts
in different parts of Now York City anri
the vicinity. A two-foot embankment
has been erected all around these courts
and as soon as the temperature drops
sufticiently to justify a hope of freezing
weather, these grounds will be Hooded.
The problem of providing sufficient in
door rinlis to accommodate the enthus
iasts when the weather is not sufti^ciently
cold to freeze the lakes and out-door
rinks is not a very difficult one. The
ease with which the Hotel Hiltmore in
stalled its rink, using the regular refrig
erating plant for the purpose, will point
the way for other institutions. It is not
unlikely, too. that the imitation Ice u:a*d
by certain vaudeville performers for their
skating stunts and which consists of a
certain composition which is laid down
in blocks, may bo utilized by roller
skating rink proprietors to convert their
houses into ice-rinks. This imitation ice
is said to he almost as good as real ice
for figure-skating and dancing purposes,
although it retarfis speed to some extent.
"Don't, worry about lack of facilities
? or ice-skat inf.." declared Mr. lirokaw,
when thi.4 i h??:o uf liie present craze
was suggested to him.
"The sport has aroused such a trem
endous storm of enthusiasm 1'iat it is
not unlikely that too .many rinks will
spring up over night. Kver.vbody seems
suddenly to have gone ice-mad.
"For years I have tried to arouse en
thusiasm In this most graceful of sports
and now that the boom has ei me I'm al
most afraid the thing may be overdone.
There tore so many people who ,iro tak

really amount to anything.. They are
going at It in the wrong way.

;jr .'
NEW YORK, Feb. 4.?Part of the
responsibility (or the skating .crazo
that has spread" over the United
'- " fStatea thla winter can bo traced to
jtbe gyrations on lea of the "Teuton
Topj-' the "Whirling Wondor"?Char
jotte Oolscblaeger.
V ' "? Charlotte?her last name Is seldom
. used In connection with her perfornv
ances on Ice, has already cost Nov
York alone a sum estimated at ?V
000,000.
f :'vlt* Is figured that much has been
?pent for skates, skating shoes, skat
ing scarfs and skating costume and In
restaurants adjoining rtnkj, since
' Charlotte started the craze.
? 'When Charlotte began to skate, she
began to break Into the newspapers.
Bhe gave skating lessons in newspa
pers. Thnt helped toe spri-nd.
Along with this it happened that
the public was found in Just the prop
er mood to make skating a fad. The
dence crate has beau on fcr somo
time. Some folk had aotuul:y dancul
tliemselvoi out. Tho public was ready
for something new. In New York, where many M*
start, Charlotte and her Ice ballet
colleagues gave the thing Impetus.
New York folk took to the rinks with
unprecedented enthusiasm. ...
Charlotte's press agent say3 she
?was in ill health before she took to
skating at the age of -6. Whatever
was the matter with Charlotte Is
Isn't any more. She does' as many
things on ice as Pavlowa does on the
stage. She is even' more daring, be
cause there is more chance for the
skates to slip than for Pavlowa to loso
control of her educated tootsies.
Charlotte' comes onto the rinl: for
her performance like a shot from a
42-centimeter gun. At the center of
the stage she brings herself up on her
right toe and begins to whirl. She
makes 23 revolutions.
There are not many Charlottes in J
the country, but there are thousands
ot Just ordinary skaters, some who
have skated for years, and many oth
ers who never put-on a pair of skates
until the craze swept over the coun
try, crowded ponds and lakes and put
thousands of dollars into the hands
of skate and skate accessory makers.</text>
