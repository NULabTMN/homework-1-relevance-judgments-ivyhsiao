	<text>Washington Skating Pass.—Jackson Haines
gave an afternoon and evening exhibition of his
skill as a skater yesterday in the presence oflargo
and astonished crowds. His skill and agility on
skates are wonderful—way above and beyond any
thing ever before witnessed in this part of oor
country. When under fall headway, he seems to
ilyasbegocs over the ice. Then, every attitude
he assumes, every movement he makes, Is frill ot
grace and beauty* Bis form is the very perfection
of manly mould, and tho excellent taste he exer
cises In the matter of dress, is a feature worthy of
special commendation. A thoroughly trained
equilibrist and gymnast, every motion of his body
Is nnderhls most perfect control. He makes no
mistakcß,'nobltmders, except {or the amusement
ol the audience. Bis Imitation of a novice on
skates ore absurdly correct, and excite the most
boisterous laughter. Haines is a native of Now
York city. Several years ago, being a remarkably
skinful skater, by theadvice of friends, ho adopted
.it as a profession, and has 'continued to follow
it, summer and winter, with lucrative success. In
winter he plays star engagements upon the parks
in the States and the Canadas, and In the summer
performs his astonishing feats on parlor skates
upon the boards of the New York theatres. He is
acknowledged to bo without an equal, as a skater,
on the Western Hemisphere. He will continue to
display his skill at tho Washington Skating Park
dnnng the present week, where we recommend all
fb go and witness a “Wg thing on Ice.”
Oouzn Skating Pads.—The managers give a
grand Carnival, at the Ogden Park this evening,
and St wQI be sure to attract a crowd.
Central Skating Pass.—Champion skaters
arc Increasing In number. Following the example
ante Washington Skating Park, tho Central Park
announces a “champion” in the person of Captain
Robert Ballenllne, a sailor, who created much ex
citement on our river, three years ago,by hia grace
ful and wondcrfhl feats on skates. He will make
his first appeal arco this afternoon, and will also
be on band In thtf evening, when there will be a
fine display of fire works. Perhaps the champions
may be brought together in a friendly test of their
skill in the art which the god DUer inaugurated
forthe pleasure and gratification of his follow
ers.</text>

	<text>A SEATING SCENE.
Prinrea sml Pr I on tbe Ico
In St. petcrabnrtT.
On the evening of February 11th the
English Skating Club gave a fete at St.
Petersburg on tbe Neva. The grounds,
if one may apply such a word to several
acres of enclosed ice, are nearly oppo
site the English Church, and the club
had converted the usually unadorned
level of their winter freehold into an
Elysian field of ice temples, magnesium
lights, colored lamps, and fires, pavil
ions, and buffets. All round the en
closed space, writes the correspondent
of tbe London Times, were hung chains
of lantps, red and blue and green, fes
tooned in pretty patterns. At one side
was the royal pavilion, with a small
supper room behind, built on the ice.
Opposite to this were two kiosks for
military bands, while at either end of
the skating field were cloak and refresh
ment rooms for the general company.
In the center of the enclosure rose a
castle of frozen-water., a trophy of ice
masonry, converted into a chapolle ar
denteby a blaze of fires and lanterns
burning at its windows and battlements.
Small citadels were also built at the
corners of the enclosed space, their
mimic architecture flushed with Bangal
lights burning within; but the most
beautiful decoration of all was the soft
sunshine streaming from electric or
magnesium lamps fixed at' intervals
round the enclosure.
The Prince and Princess of Wales, the
Duke and Duchess ofEdiuburgh, Prince
Arthur, the Crown Prince of Denmark,
the Czarevitch, Czarevna, and the Grand
Dukes Vladimir and Alexis were pres
ent, and each and all entered heartily
into the skating, seeming thoroughly to
enjoy themselves. It was, indeed, a
welcome contrast and relief amid the
never-ending succession of balls and
dinners, which offer nothing half so
joyous as gliding to and fro over smooth
ice, to tbe sound of music, in the (lash
iag light of magnesium lanterns, and by
the rainbows of ten thousand colored
lamps. Then, also, one had the pleas
ure of seeing princes and princesses in
the flesh as it were, not sitting at high
tables or walking in marshalled pro
cessions, transfigured with stars and
ribands and jewels and long trains, and
taking their pleasure with the rest, as
ordinary mortals, onjoying no special
exemption even from collisions and
tumbles. The Grand Dukes are good
go-a bend skaters, very Jehus in their
furious driving of ladies' chairs, and the
Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edin
burgh, the Crown Prince of Denmark
and Prince Arthur, can bold their own
with the beat. The Princess of Wales
and Czarevna kept their skates on for a
very long time, and it was pretty to
watcn me Bisters gnuing aiong iiaim iu
band, or in a chair with three or four
gentlemen. Sometimes a ring would
form round the great American skater,
Mr. Jackson Haines, watching him exe
cute his marvellously dexterous and
graceful gyrations and gymnastics, ut
terly astonishing to the ordinary skater.
All the while the music played, and it
was near one o'clock before a crowd of
skaters gathered near the pavilion gave
a farewell cheer to the royal and impe
rial skaUrs.</text>

	<text>FIGURE SKATING NOW
ONE OF THE FINE ARTS
Best Exhibitions in World
: Are to Be Seen in
• .iNewYork
Skating has come to-be one of the;
fine arts. : While the records for speed
on th,e ice are perhaps most talked of,
the advance in fancy or figure skating
is quite as remarkable. The extent
to which .figure skating has been devel
oped, both at home, and abroad, .will
come as a surprise to most laymen In
such matters.. It is not generally
known. . again,. that the so called con
tinental style, .which is the standard in
all the great, skating . countries, is a
direct v outgrowth of the distinctively
American style, which was Introduced
into' Europe forty years ago. And, in
cidentally, probably the best skaters In
the world today, judged by the most
rigid rules, are: to be found in several
American cities.'-,
'America is today the only great skat-
Ing country in the world which Is not
regularly, represented in the Interna
tional skating union; This organization
at present: fixes the rules. for all com
petitive events, and it is under its
auspices that the great skating meets
are carried out. ;\u25a0 The official recogni
tion of American skill in skating
amounts to. nothing, however, since the
present standards for fancy skating the
world over are largely based upon
American standards. Any skillful
American skater, moreover, with a lit
tle practice, could readily acquaint him
self - with the rules as observed in
Europe. ,- c In point of fairness the ac
cepted standard in skating should
therefore, be called the international
style. - v. " '...-.
The present standards of figure skat-
Ing ; werei established by an American
ii a n C « SO tK lneS| In fiur °Pe. a trifle
more J.han forty years ago. j .Since his
time there have grown up the so called
Austrian, : Swedish and Russian schools
but fl fSht B Sri a fu whlch are - * fter h
Within the last fe-w years the same
general methods have been adopted ' in
•England,, so that this style, originally
American,.. may be accepted as truly
international. In each" country during
the last forty years, since the introduc
tion, of American methods into Eu
rope there has been more or less orig
inal development. : \ --
Since the year 1891 there has been an
annual meet, which has been attended
by \u0084the ? representatives of the great
skating countries of Europe. . which "
naturally .the great : event of its kind
forskate»s-the world over. For s«v
fh^TT 76 .^ 2? Americ 5 n - whether from
the United States; or Canada, has quali
fied for an international competition of
figure/ skating: •. Meanwhile in the
United States many, distinctive tricks
or methods of skating have been de
yeloped. ilt is safe :to say that
American skaters ; are' the best in the
world, it. is ; none the less Interesting
to 5 note ; what Europeans have been
doing:-, with the American style in the
last few years.
J The claim -that some of the best

skater.^no *friatte"r3what;Jiisiindividual
style.^will fdoj well>'to,fstudy.v~- For"; the
beginner.^ these "<•\u25a0 laws \u25a0 are the correct
grammar . of skating. These general
rules have been laid down by Georgs
H. Browne, •A. M. The questions of
correct carriage and movement are
very ' definite. The best authorities hold
that the body while skating should be
held upright, should not be bent at the
hips but should be held at all times
without stiffness. The bend of the
knee or body should only be mo
mentary. The head should be held up- •
right. - .
Again, . in skating the unemployed
foot should be held only a little way
from the ice and should never be
dragged behind. . The toe should be
turned downward and outward. Th«
knee should be only slightly bent and
generally held behind the unemployed
foot, but should always be awunjc
freely, so* as to assist the general
movement, but without at any tim«
being held fax out in any direction.
Many skaters of real talent make a
mistake in so simple a matter as the
position of the arms. The arms should
hang down easily, but without stiff?
ness.
• They may be used like the unem
ployed foot, to assist the movement of
the body, but the elbow and hand
should be kept near the body and ex
cept in rare instances the hands should
not be raised above the waist line.
The fingers should be neither spread
nor clinched.' but held In a natural
position. The aim 1 should be to avoid
everything; violent or> angular and the
impression; should be given that one is
skating without effort.
In the tournaments held under th«
rules of. the European clubs -there Is
no precise standard for the size of , the
figures skated. The size of th« figures
cut or. the ice should be adapted to tho.
size and build of the skater. The tend
ency to skate large figures Is discour
aged because such skating tends to In
stability; a slowing of the pace and
awkwardness of carriage. The idea is
to make the manner of execution more
Important Jthan the mere cutting of
beautiful prints on the Ice.' Good form
consists In unbroken, rhythmic transi
tion. * *
:, The figure skater Is first Instructed
In a series of prescribed exercises
which are known under the rules as
compulsory, figures. , These consist of a
series'" of simple curves, growing more
complicated as the skater progresses.
When 1 these preliminaries have been
mastered the skater graduates into the
class where free skating.' as it is named.
Is permitted— that is. .the skating of
optional figures and for a specified
length, of time.
".The compulsory figures may be called
the " grammar ' of . skating. . The free
skating, to , continue the 'figure. Is th»
rhetoric of ''the art of figure skating.
The compulsory figures. In other worda.
comprise, a series of curves, the com
bination of simple lines so selected that
each illustrates - a distinctive i trick ;In
skating. ; It Is the combination of theso"
various \u25a0'\u25a0 curves , that ,- forms > the com
plicated figures of the so called fre*
skating grbups. In any regular tour
nament the contestants are required to
skate six of . these compulsory figures.
Every .compulsory figure again ... must
be'eommenced from rest— that is. only
a single strike of the other foot. The
change from one foot to the othermust
be -made without 'pause and with a
single" stroke.; Every figure again must
bei repeated three times, both on the
rightfand on the left foot, the repeti
tion to follow .without pause/..
" The free[skating .which follows under
the; rules must comprise attractive and
graceful -j figures which will -~ arrange
themselves • into : a coherent unit. *] Ther*
should |be "a .continuous" swing without
breaks s or* awkwardness of ~any ! kind;

	<text>A,L
HEALTHY revival of interest in
one of the greatest of winter
sports, ice skating, has been
brought about by the cessa
tion of hostilities between the different
unions that govern this sport this sea*
son. The action of the International
Bkating union, which controls the sport
in Canada and In the United States, in
taking away the charter of the old
Eastern Amateur Skating association
has been heartily Indorsed.
As a result of the renewed Interest
many, clubs throughout the country
have become very active and more
races have been skated at the various
links than ever before.
While loe skate racing ts gaining In
popularity every year, figure skating
has become almost a lost art In Ameri
ca, but there is a movement on foot
to stimulate renewed interest in expert
figure-skating, whose devotees have
/become fewer and fewer In recent
v-'years. It is proposed to Introduce a
^system known as the international
style, which has grown so popular
'f among the enthusiasts abroad that
if there is now a generally accepted
standard of. competition throughout the
European continent and the British
Isles. Countless organisations through
out Europe foster the sport, and a sur
prlslrigly large number of contests of
national and international character
are held in the season.
Abroad very little racing is done on
skates, but figure experts can be seen
daily by the hundreds on the various
outdoor rinks. The International Skat
tag union announced the location and
dates for the union's championships
this year recently. The figure cham
pionship of the world was fixed for
championship was set for Vienna Feb.
1, while St. Petecsburg gets the cham
pionship of Europe title for Feb. 25 and
26. The speed championship of Europe
will be at Hamar Feb. 18 and 19, with
the world's speed championship at
Dronthelm, Feb. 25 and 26.
Figure 8kating.
Many people consider all skaters as
one class of athletes. They know too
little of the vast difference between the
methods of the speed expert and those
of the figure star and work on the the
ory that the racing man must also be
an able executed of rancy strokes, sim
ply because he is proficient- in track
contests, and vice versa. Nothing could
be more fallacious. Tou might as well
believe a billiard champion to be a for
midable pool player through the fact
that he understands the use of a cue.
Figure and speed skating are separate
arts, Just as billiards is in nowise simi
lar to pool.
1
The figure skater is more of what
might be termed an artist than is the
speed, performer. He is credited in
competitions for the carriage and bal
ance of his body, the facility with
which he cuts figures, the accuracy of
his strokes, etc. His racing brother, on
the contrary, wins by crossing the fin
ish line first. Irrespective of the tech
nical perfection of his stroke or the de
gree of development toward the mastery
et,..what, ponetUutes good form. Of
fibu*s« the carefully trained, scientific
racer economizes in strength and wind
by following approved and hence im
proved methods, but his glory and gold
medals are the rewards of strength,
speed and endurance more than skill.
The beginner in figure skating finds
the approach to this fascinating pas
time hedged by difficulties. Unless
he is determined to succeed he will
never rise above mediocrity, which
condition every right minded person
should abhor in any branch of en
deavor. First the beginner must learn
what to do, next how to do it and
than how to do It perfectly. Lastly
be must practice faithfully, bo that hi*
muscles will receive ntctatry train*
int. that hip balance and polae will be
Improved and his knowledge of flfurei
made comprehensive. One figure leads
to another, just as arithmetic paves
the way tor algebra and geometry in
school. Simple strokes graduate into
the combinations, and these in turn
merge into the complex. Only he that
baa a trustworthy knowledge of the
skating alphabet will force himself In
to the highen circles of competition
and accomplishment Therefore take
time by the forelock and build.your
reputation on,a firm foundation.
"Imitate tlui leaders" I* the rule laid
down for beginners in many lines of
ahtletlcs, and to some extent It Is a
good one tor ambitious figure skaters.
Single out some expert and watchhlm
so closely that he may suspect you of
being a detective on his track, tyit do
not sacrifice your own individuality In
your style.

CE skating has more ele

I any other sport known to
mankind. It is popular
among a larger number
of people probably than
any other sport in the
world. It, may be learned in extreme
youth and it retains far into old age the
wonderful potency of its fascination. It
makes for strong, supple muscles, expand
ed lungs, graceful bearing, quickened eye.
zcstful appetite and restful sleep. In its
best form, known only to the persevering
student, it is as .ntneate as a game of
chef, appealing as thoroughly to the
trained mind as to the disciplined muscles.
The very fact that the sport is difficult
partly explains its attraction, for in sports,
as in other things that which is easy
loses its interest. Probably in no other
pastime known to the world are there so
few real champions, and therefore so
much room for the ambitious seeker after
leadership
Once Leaders of Sport.
Surely the Tjnited States, the greatest
outdoor nation of history, ought to lead
in this the greatest outdoor pastime in
fhe world We did once And it is
planned that we shall again. Here are
the plans
Jackson Haines, the finest exponent of
artistic and daring figure skating pro
duced by the United States during the
nineteenth century, went to Europe in
1S64 and became the sensation of every
skating centre It is historically true
that this American skater was the father
of the present developed style of figure
skatinc used on the Continent He
made exhibitions before all the crowned
heads of Northern Europe, children,
rinks, skating figures and other things
were named after him, and so remark
ably successful was his tour that he re
mained there until his death. He lies
buried in a little village of Finland, and
his monument, erected by the peasants,
hrars the interesting inscription: "Jack
son Haines, the American Skating King.
Then, having taught the world how to
do the thing, we ceased practising it our
selves, and drifted from leadership to the
foot of the class. During the last quar
ter of a century no American amateur
dared show himself in the contests of
Europe. Our skating would have drawn
roars of derision in any skating centre of
the world We were utterly discredited
in the field which was once ours without
the trouble of competition. It was a
curious situation.
Chief among the causes of this condi
tion was the stupid retention of rules long
outgrown. Every athletic authority
knows the necessity for constant revision
of the rules to meet developments in the
game. But for twenty years a little
coterie of veterans, self appointed cus
todians of the sport, insisted upon retain
ing a mossbacked and barnacled cham
pionship programme. Good as it might
have been when it was originated in 1S60
after Haines startled all Europe with his
work, the American has gone abroad who
knew enough about skating to analyze
skating secrets, and from a study of the
skating styles of all the northern nations
of Europe has discovered that they are
even to-day using the same movements.

Mr. O. B. Haycock, of Ottawa, promi
nent in the MInto Skating Club and part
ner of Lady Evelyn Grey in skating ex
hibitions in Canada and at the Arena in
Boston last winter, will probably become
one of the vice presidents of the club.
Miss E. Kingford and Mr. Phillip Chrys

and Mr. Haycock compose the famous

Identical pattern of skate which Haines
introduced. So bsck to the old home
comes the lost art, safe in the custody
of one who treasures it with the en
thusiasm of the man with a hobby, and
with it the scheme for the founding of an
international organization which shall
maintain the traditions of the past as well
as meet the advances of the future. In
stead of being jealous of the American
scheme, the world of skaters recognizes
the right of Jackson Haines' countrymen
to be leaders m a plan to bring together
the best skaters and the best skating
styles of the world.
American Styles.
There remains, however, this interest
ing difference, that while Jackson Haines
received scant recognition from the social
leaders of his day, the present revival
of the new international style of skating
has the advantage of exponents and ad
vocates of the highest social prominence
here and abroad. Then, too, Haines was
a professional, while those who are at
the front of this new movement have
the additional prestige of amateurs, giv
ing their services as a labor of love.
The style of skating which may be
called nationally American, to contrast
It with the Continental or international
style, is familiar to every frequenter of
our rinks or frozen ponds. Soon after
the beginner has learned the threes and
a feW backward steps., he begins to do
figure movements of eights, on one or
both feet, with loops, bracket', anvils,
Maltese crosses, ic. The fault with our
skating, and the thing which It is pro
posed to remedy, is that wc skate all our
figures much too small, too rapidly, and
that we are careless in the carnage of
the arms and the body. We have a re
strained pose entirely out of keeping with
the freedom characteristic of this beau
tiful form of motion
We have long been accused of being
"barrel bead" skaters, that is, of pre
ferring to do our intricate figures in a
tiny circle no bigger than the head of a
barrel. It must be clear even to the
superficial obserrcr that this form of skat
ing is far removed from what graceful
skating ought to be. And added to the
smaiincss oi inc usures mere is asso
ciated a speed which makes them utterly
Incomprehensible. It was for many years

Even before Mr. Irving Brokaw, of New
York, one of the younger leaders in so
ciety and athletics, won the American
amateur skating championship, he was
recognized as the most graceful skater
of championship calibre America had pro
duced in decades. But he was no medsl
hunter. The history and the philosophy
of the sport attracted him and he began
collecting data. The result was bis su

With ample leisure to indulge his hobby
and with cosmopolitan tastes, Mr. Brokaw
soon became welcome among the famous
skating resorts of Europe, where the
name of Jackson Haines is by no means
forgotten. He recognized the deficiencies
of the cramped American style and em
ployed Herr Bror Meyer, the Swedish

Irving Brokaw, assisted by a coterie of
society folk fond of the sport, debnite
work has already been done. There are
rooms reserved for the club in which the

the Ice so that the correct position can be
obtained by study of the glass. This
latter feature, while familiar to the pa
trons of the best rinks of Europe, hss
never before been employed in this coun
try. By the International Skating Club local
competitions are to be encouraged, and
there will be a national contest for the
selection of national champions. Through
the efforts of those who are Interested in

Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Syers, of London,
have all been heard from and are in sym
pathy with the plans. It is possible that
quite a coterie of famous foreign skaters
may be seen here another winter.
Fancy dancing, which has been enjoy
ing such a furore during the present win
ter among society folk, has been taken
up by the figure skating fraternity and
bids fair to be a distinct find in the field
of sport. Jackson Haines himself was
a famous dancer and many of his move
ments were executed to dance music. The
best waltzer on skates in the world is
probably Miss Muriel Harrison, of the
Princes Rink, London, who has herself
originated several new waltz steps ac
cepted by the experts.
As to skates, the best experts in the
world are now using almost the idebtical
model which Jackson Haines introduced
into Europe fifty years ago. It should
be round toed that is, the skate blade
should be carried forward and curled
over toward the toes. But it should not
touch the toes, nor should it he attached
to the front of the footplate. On this
forward curt there should be deep cor
rugations for toe spins and -pirouettes.
The only skater of prominence who does
not use this skate is Grenadier, the Eng
lishman, and he has a style peculiar to
himself.
The Correct Skate.
The skate should have but two stanch
ions or uprights from blade to footplate.
The toeplate should never be fastened to
the shoe at its front edge, but at or back
of the ball of the foot, allowing ample
freedom for the action of the toes. The
power of the stroke, or what might be
termed the thrust, should come from the
ball of the foot. These are the explana
tions of the undoubted easier and faster
running of the new skating equipment.
and they have been accepted everywhere.
Mr. Brokaw may be said to have discov
ered them. As to the width of the blade
of the skate there is some difference of
opinion, the preference being for about
a quarter inch blade. The radius should
be about nine feet, that is the curve of
the blade, carried out, would make a circle
nine feet in diameter. The skate de
scribed is now being made in this coun
try. It is appropriate after all these
years that we should be supplying the
world with the skate which revolution
ized skating.
The shoes for skating should be firmly-
snug around the heel and allow ample
freedom for the movement of the toes
while lying firm over the instep. They
should curve In just above the back of
the heel so as to fit the foot when the
leg is bent slightly at the knee, which
is the customary position for figure move
ments. As to height, there is general
agreement that ten inches is about right,
since the free use of the muscles of the
calf and leg should not be interfered with
and the full strength of the heavy ankl
muscles should be available if needed.
In the matter of clothing, freedom is
the one essential. The foreign men skat
ers all use the tight fitting jersey costume,
which is sung and yet elastic, but our
skaters feel a bit too professional in such
a rig. Knickerbockers or riding breeches
are desirable and a soft, black leather
legging is regarded as more correct than
the henry black pigskin puttee.
Interest in winter sports grows apace.

"In 1861," he added, "when the ball
went tip in -November, we had sixty-three
daya skating, the next best record of
fifty-three daya being In 1808-80. During
tho laat four years tho fluctuations havo
been like this: In tho wintor or 1008-09 the

were twenty-four days skating; last win

a probable forty-ftve or fifty this winter.
The first .Sunday of this month 30.000
persons sKaiea on tno (.entrai l-arn lases,

At a big retail store devoted exclu

for a week or more the firm had been
hardly, able to get ice skates fast enough
to meet the demands of customers, the
usual stock having boen sold out soon
after the beginning or the big freeze.
This la not all: Twice as many women
as usual are learning to skate this winter,
an instructor said, and more women than
men, speaking generally, are excelling In
(ancy skating, having more time to prac
tise and usually learning more easily.
The other day, for Instance, a small
woman at the rink who excited Interest

up entirely. I decided about two weeks
ago that I should like to know the feel of a
pair of skates again, though 1 felt almost
afraid to try. But it seems that one never
forgets how to skate, and now I am tak
ing Icsrons In fancy skating."
The earlier the .better la a good rule to
apply to learning to skate, nevertheless
women far past their salad days are
putting on skates for the first time this
winter, and the number of almost elderly
women seen atilndoor skating places is
astonishing. Collectively, the enthusiasts
admit, these rare conditions have been
Immensely favorable to the cause of fancy
skating.
Before explaining that the Continental
variety alma to make an art or fancy
skating and to replace the go as you please
style of Jerky, restricted movements with
larger, freer strokeswhlchmake for grace
rather than speed instructors usually
make it plain that after all to America
belongs the distinction of originating the
Continental style of skating and that the
only reason Europe got to practising this
first was that half a century ago Ameri
cans probably deserved the criticism that
they were not lovers of out door sports.
Had It been otherwise America never
would havo allowed Jackson Haines, the
originator of daring and really beautiful
figure skating, to leave his own country
in 1808 for lack of patronage, to be re
ceived with acclaim all over Europe.
And had women taken the same Interest
In outdoor sports then that they take
now it might not havo happened nnyway.
Mc. Haines was handicapped by tho Tact
that ho won a professional who Incidentally
had a certain make of skate he wanted to
get on tho market. But for this his bones
might have boen resting, now in America
instead of in a Finland cemetery, under
a monument erected by admiring natives
and inscribed "The American Skating
King." Fortunately for" the relntroduo
tion here of tho stylo of skating originated
by Haines, its most active sponsors are
amateurs with no personal ends to serve
who are indifferent even to capturing
medals. What concerns them most Is
the painful truth that until very recently
no American amateur haa dared to ap
pear in European contests.
Mr. Irving Brokaw, head enthusiast
and who, having leisure and money to
indulge in his favorite sport took lessons
or the best professionals in Europe said
that our skating would have been laughed
at in any skating centre of Europe and
that Americans were in the curious posi
tion or being discredited in a sport which
once belonged to them wlthout.the need
of competition.
To make a break in the listing order
of things Mr. Brokaw entered an amateur
competition at St. Moritz, Switzerland,
and captured a prize, the first ever taken
by an American for skating in Continental
style. Since then Mr. Brokaw haa been
invited to take port in the world's cham
pionships held in Manchester, England,
this month, the first invitation of the kind
received by an American. It is not too
much to expect that before long America
will be able to furnish both men and
women amateurs in plenty able to com
pete for the world's championships.
On this point Mr. Brokaw said:
"I look for a wonderful development
in figure skating over here in the next
two years. It is evident, I think, that
the Continental movements will become
immensely popular and that grace, ease
and beauty will soon bo leading charac
teristics of American as well as or European
skating. The theory or the art haa been
reduced to such a practical basis that boys
and girls, men and women may learn
to skate from printed instructions. To
learn figure skating one must devote hfin
seir to figure skating. There Is a special
figure skate, curved on the bottom so as
to make curves and circles entirely possi
ble. It is round toed, and on this forward
url are deep corrugations for too spins
Praotlcally thla model, used by fancy
skatera the world over, Is identical with
that Introduced by Jackson Halnea to
Europo fifty years ago.
"Ono of tho principal features of figure
skating," Mr. Brokaw continued, "Is the
curve. To be able to control the circles
means that ono has gained the power
to maintain the body In graceful atti
tudes. Every ono should skate large Jig'
ures first.
Tho International style is free, un
cramped and artistic, after the manner
of the Hubs ion dancers. In teaching this
instructors insist that the head shall be
erect, the eves seldom or never on the ioe,
the bodr held upright, not bent forward
or sideways from the hips; shoulders back
chest expanded. The arms, active or
passive, should have free play from the
shoulders, the elbows slightly bent, the
hands held with palms downward or
Inward. Speed Is not a feature of the

The old American method pay Uttle
attention to position. A skater may do
anything ho likes with his arms. The
strictly Ennliah style of skating, while
more uniform. Is about as ungraceful.

of whom axe Mrs. Harry La Montague,
Miss de Coppet and Ellis Hoffman, one
would say that ballet dancing is easy
compared with tns new figure skating
on Ice.
Besides walUlnff and standing on their
toes, these skaters hop, skip, jump and
twirl while skimming over the ice as
eraoefully as birds. According to a
Canadian professional there are 1,100
different figures to Continental skating.
How many of these New lorkers nave
mastered no one knows, but among the
wonderful figures which may be called
almoet popular now a re the swallow and
the sea gull, the ten step, the Choctaw
Indian, the spread eagle watte, tho spiral.
the rocker turn, the corkscrew spin, the
split toe, the opera swing, the tandem
glide. To name them is easy enough;
to give any idea of how they are done Is
almost Impossible. The walte, which
except ror a longer glide, is much like
.he average ballroom waltz and Is callod
an easy figure, is one of tho most popular
To prove how thoroughly In earnest
the amateur promoters or Continental
figure skating in America are, an Inter
national Skating Club was organized
last weok under tho direction of Mr.
Brokaw with headquarters at tho St.
Nicholas rink and a membership of fifty,
comprising soma of tho beet amatourn
hero and in Boston, tho lattor city bulng
quite as onthuslastlo as Now York over
tho now stylo fancy skating.
Said Mr. Brokaw: "For some tlmo
tentatiro plans have been under con
sideration for the formation of such a
club, and when It was seen tit-it tho Interest
excited by tho introduction of Continental
ngiiro skating over, hero was taking root
instead of dying out, some of us went
uhead and organized a club whose main
purpose will be to encourage local nnd
national amateur competitions. From
all over this country nnd from Europe
have come to mo expressions of Interest
in (he club. Canada too says It wants
to be represented. Mr. Haycock, who
often takes part with Lady Evelyn Grey
in Canadian skating' competitions, is to
be enrolled us a member. From London
comes word that the Duko and Duchess
of Bedford, tho former president of tho
Figure Skating Club of London, are much
Interested In tho aims of tho International
Skating Club, as uro also Mr. and Mrs
Edgar Myers, Mrs. Syers being tho cliani'
Dion woman skater of huioiw. I ho club
proposes to organize the skaters and have
clulis in various localities.
"The International Skating Club of Eu
rope includes in Its membership repre
sentatives from all the skating countries
except America. At the headquarters
in St. Nicholas Itlnk there will be u room
fitted with lockers for the use of members.
Tho latest foreign periodicals devoid
to ico sports will bo kept on Hie; tO"
will bo bulletins announcing skating com
petitions and c.irnl vow, and phologrnplis
of famous skaters. The equipment will
include also a hugo portable mirror which
may bo moved to the sido of tho lee so
that correct positions can be studied by
critical skaters. This feature is not
new in Europo but it has never before
boon used over here.
Tho Philadelphia Skating Club, organ
ized In 1810, was, I believe, the flrot of
tho kind in this country, or at least the
first of any Importanco, nnd Philadelphia
is taking almost us much interest aa Uos

ciety is practising the Continental style
of skating more generally, I think, than

and the modern school of ballet dancing on the
Ice. The latter style of skating Is exactly the
same as the ballet dancing on the Boor, and tbe
training for it is similar to the work of the bal
let dancer. It consists of tricks, and everything
is done for effect. Pantomime Is introduced,
and the arms and legs are employed regardless
Of the rules and Ideas of strict sMirt.
"A very fine example of the European ballet
on Ice Is to be seen at the Hippodrome, Char
lotte Is probably the best of her kind. But how
many amateurs would care to skate In this
manner?
"It needs training from early childhood, and
Is only useful for professional exhibitions. It
Is the same as ballet dancing and modern danc
ing the difference, for Instance, between a
toe dancer and Mrs. Vernon Castle.
"To the sNirtsman or woman, form must
naturally mean more than tricks and acrobatics.
It Is far better to execute the simplest edge in
the correct International manner than to per
forin a so-called 'stunt,' which to the experienced
skater really means nothing.
"The best teachers and first class profes
sionals In Kurope (which is the home of the
new school i skate in strict form and do not
advocate any other than the simple Continental
school. That docs not mean that spins, pirou

"Many people do not know the difference In
the school of skating, and I have not tbe
time to explain it, but before continuing I
would like to say that the American style con
sists of grapevines, twists, and their figures are
mostly executed in a tiny apace on two feet.
These figures are entirely out of date and as
old fashioned as the barn dance. The best
American skaters have adopted the Continental
method, and Irving Brokaw has done n great
deal to belp the sport and tbe International
style.
"Tbe latter method excludes all violent, ugly,
angular or stiff action and gives the skater a

	<text>Fashionable Society Now Busy with 6 6Ice Teas99 and
((Dansants a Glace99 and Not Enough Skating
Rinks or Instructors to Meet the Demand
ICE skating, or rather dancing on
Bkates. Is the newest fashionable
amusement. There is every indica
tion that the new craze, which already
is country-wide In extent, will be taken
tup by people of all ages, and In all
walks of life, with the same <>tithuBlasm
that has converted men, women and
children into fox-trotters and tango-ex
perts during the past three or four sea
sons.
Skating on ice is considerably more
difficult for adults to learn than dancing
Dancing on the ice is a feat which only
export skaters dare to tackle. Never
theless, the difficulties of the new fad
Beem to have had little effect on Us
popularity, and the rlnkB throughout the
country are now crowded morning, noon
and night with debutantes and society
matrons who are determined to become
expert skaters and Ice-dancers In the
shortest possible time.
The dauceB which expert skaters are
able to execute on the ice Include the
old-fashioned waltz, the ten-step, another
form of waltc, the fox-trot and various
modifications of the other dances which
have become popular in recent seasons.
While these ice-dances look extremely
difficult to perform, the accomplishment
follows easily enough after the funda
mental figures of figure-skating ha\o
been acquired. A good figure-skater can
learn new figures with as much facility
as a dancer learnB new steps. The miin
thing that is necessary is to become
adept at ordinary figure-skating. Danc
ing on Ice will then follow easily r-noueh,
although, of course, it will require a good
deal of practise.
The foundation of all figure-skating is
the ability to use the four edges of the
skates?the Inside left, the outside left,
the inside ri?ht and the outside right,
and to be able to skate backward on
either of these edges Just as readily as
forward. Dally practise on these funda
mentals is essential to progress in ice
dancing.
The fact that the new amusement has
already taken a firm hold is evidenced
In many ways Four of New York's
most fashionable hotels have already
planned ice rinks ;"or the use of their
patrons. The Hill more is the first to
open Its rink to the public. The Wal
dorf is 6aid to be investing in the
neighborhood of a million dollars in
rink on the roof of its new annex. The
Hotel Astor and the McAlpin are now
arranging similar facilities. Some of the
rostaurantB and cabarets which have
hitherto made their dancing-floors their
principal attraction are preparing to sub
stitute ice for hard-wood so that those
who havt danced may hereafter skate
instead.
Most significant of all. perhap-. is the
thorough manner in which New York,
Boston and Chicago society has taken
the lead in adopting the new fad. In
New York, a club was formed several
weeks ago by enthusiasts and its mem
bership includes most of the debutantes
of the season, the girls who are to come
out next year and some young married
people. Among subscribers to the club
are Mrs. John .lacob A&tor, Mr. and Mrs.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, Mr. and Mrs. Ed
win Gould. Mr. and Mrs. Irving I3rokaw
and a host of others whose names are
Terv well known In the most exclusive
social circles.
ThiB club has engased the St. Nicholas
Skating Rink for .Monday afternoons for
the entire season, which lasts until the
end of April. Professional skaters and
Instructors have been engaeed to In
struct the members in the intricacies of
Ice-dancing.
In Boston, expert Bkaters have been
engaged by the Boston Skating Club, an
exclusive organization, to teach society
the new fad. Mr. and Mrs. A. Windsor
Wills. Miss Eleanora Soars and Miss
Edith Rotch are. perhaps, the most promi
nent of Back Bay fashionables who are
leading the movement In New England.
In Chicago, the Sherman House some
time ago anticipated the present craze
and installed a skating-rink In the Col
lege Inn, In the basement, in place of the
dancing floor. Tt was foreseen that danc
ing was losing its hold and that ic.e-skat
inz was Koing to take its place. The
change has met with great success.
That the general public Is goine: to
follow society's lead and make skating
the principal diversion this Winter Is in
dicated plainly bv the unusually large
number of people who have already
taken up the snort at the rinks.
At St. Nicholas Rink, for Instance, rec
cord crowds have Ifeen in attendance at
every session since the opening of the
season on November 1. Thir. rink ac
commodates S00 people on the Ice at a
time and there are three sessions a day.
Men and women of all aees arc clamor
ing for instruction or for a chance to
practise and perfect themselves in the
new skating dances
The same situation ,prevails at the
other rinks throughout the country.
There are two large rinks on the Const,
one at Seattle and the other at Portland.
Both are dolnn a record business, and
similar enthusiasm is evident in Detroit.
Cleveland. Pittsburgh, and Chicago. *
The new amusement will not score its
greatest triumph, perhaps, until freez
ing weather arrives, when the limited
capacity of the indoor rinks will be
augments^ by the unlimited facilities
of the park lakes, BtreamH
and out-door rinks. Then.
of courBe, there will be
sufficient outlet for all the
pent-up enthusiasm which the
craze 1b hound to arouse in
the meantime.
Evidently that is what the
manufacturers of sporting
goods und apparel are relying
upon mainly, for although the
indoor skating season is now
a month or two old, the large
skate factories are still run
ning on a twenty-four hour
schedule in three shifts in an
effort to cope with the tre
mendous demand for skates
which they are confident will
materialize within the next
two or three months.
Up-to-date skating has brougnt with it
Its own special styles of wearing ap
parel. All the costume makers and
manufacturers of wearing apparel have
vied with each other in getting out at
tractive skating designs and the big re
tail stores have given considerable spate
in their advertising to the beautiful
creations which have been made avail
able for followers of the new c^aze. Thi<*
factor, in itself, it is believed, will insure
the popularity of ire-dancing. Indeed, it
has been suggested that women may be
tempted to take up skating in order to
wear the new garments rather than to
purchase the new garments for the sake
of skating.
in liiiQ with this phase of the situation,
a series of weekl> fashion shows de
voted to garments specially designed for
skating has been arranged at the St.
Nicholas Rink. Already several of the
well known women'* specialty houses
have exhibited their models at these dis
plays. and the remarkably effective cos
tumes which skating has developed are
certainly not calculated to deter women
irom lulling into hue.
The social opportunities wiiich the
new craze affords are considerable. Al
ready two elaborate Ice-Teas or "dan
sauts a glace" have been given by Mr.
and Mrs. Irving Brokaw, in which the
skating stage of the Hippodrome was
engaged.
On these occasions, the guests of the
Brokaws to the number of about 100
participated in the general ice-dancing
and were then entertained by Mr.
Brokaw. probably the most accomplished
amateur figure-skater In the world.

Raymond Townsend, of New Haven, who
gave a special exhibition of fancy-skating,
their partners being the famous Hippo

present, bringing with them Mr .and

one is able (l?'iinitely to explain. Per
haps the largest single factor it> arous
ing interest in skating, however, has
heen the wonderful exhibition given by
Charlotte and her associates at the
Hippodrome. The Ballet on Ice was
brought from the Admiralpalast, at lb-r
liu, by Mr. Dillingham and has been uni
versally admired. The Shuberts have
helped to foster Interest in the new
diversion by converting the "Castles in
the Air" cabaret, on top of the Forty
fourth Street Theatre, into an Ire Palace,
where every evening a skating troupe dis
plays its skill on real ice.
Particularly significant is tho fact that
some of the most accomplished of the
professional dangers who have hitherto
been featured at the Hroadwuj cabarets,
sensing the drift of things, have taken
up dancing on ice and are not only giv
ing exhibitions but instruction.
Kiloen Molyneux and Clifton Webb, of
the Town Topics Company, for instance,
who made such a hit as professional
dancers, have shown equal skill at fox
trotting on skates in the rinks. Norvel
Hnprie and Isabel Mutler, at the Castles
in the Air. have similarly forsaken the
old-style hardwood dancing for the more
graceful and more diflii-uit feat of ice
dancing.
Preparations to accommodate tho thou
sands of skate-mad enthusiasts who will
bo clamoring for a chunco to display
their skill, or lack of it. as soon as the
first freezing weather sets in. have been
Kathleen Pope and George Kerner
made at the various public tennis courts
in different parts of Now York City anri
the vicinity. A two-foot embankment
has been erected all around these courts
and as soon as the temperature drops
sufticiently to justify a hope of freezing
weather, these grounds will be Hooded.
The problem of providing sufficient in
door rinlis to accommodate the enthus
iasts when the weather is not sufti^ciently
cold to freeze the lakes and out-door
rinks is not a very difficult one. The
ease with which the Hotel Hiltmore in
stalled its rink, using the regular refrig
erating plant for the purpose, will point
the way for other institutions. It is not
unlikely, too. that the imitation Ice u:a*d
by certain vaudeville performers for their
skating stunts and which consists of a
certain composition which is laid down
in blocks, may bo utilized by roller
skating rink proprietors to convert their
houses into ice-rinks. This imitation ice
is said to he almost as good as real ice
for figure-skating and dancing purposes,
although it retarfis speed to some extent.
"Don't, worry about lack of facilities
? or ice-skat inf.." declared Mr. lirokaw,
when thi.4 i h??:o uf liie present craze
was suggested to him.
"The sport has aroused such a trem
endous storm of enthusiasm 1'iat it is
not unlikely that too .many rinks will
spring up over night. Kver.vbody seems
suddenly to have gone ice-mad.
"For years I have tried to arouse en
thusiasm In this most graceful of sports
and now that the boom has ei me I'm al
most afraid the thing may be overdone.
There tore so many people who ,iro tak
ing up skating now who will never
really amount to anything.. They are
going at It in the wrong way.

Along with this it happened that
the public was found in Just the prop

tliemselvoi out. Tho public was ready
for something new. In New York, where many M*
start, Charlotte and her Ice ballet
colleagues gave the thing Impetus.
New York folk took to the rinks with
unprecedented enthusiasm. ...
Charlotte's press agent say3 she
?was in ill health before she took to
skating at the age of -6. Whatever
was the matter with Charlotte Is
Isn't any more. She does' as many
things on ice as Pavlowa does on the
stage. She is even' more daring, be
cause there is more chance for the
skates to slip than for Pavlowa to loso
control of her educated tootsies.
Charlotte' comes onto the rinl: for
her performance like a shot from a
42-centimeter gun. At the center of
the stage she brings herself up on her
right toe and begins to whirl. She
makes 23 revolutions.
There are not many Charlottes in J
the country, but there are thousands
ot Just ordinary skaters, some who
have skated for years, and many oth
ers who never put-on a pair of skates
until the craze swept over the coun
try, crowded ponds and lakes and put
thousands of dollars into the hands
of skate and skate accessory makers.</text>

7V7V* f The Proper Equip

of Form and the Funda
mental Principles of Figure
Skating.
By Mr. Irving Bro haw
Champion Figure Skater of America, Author of “The Art of Sksttng," Ito.
THE present craze of Ice-dancing
will be a great thing for the art
of skating If it Increase* the
number of those who skate correctly.
It will be a very bad thing if It produce*
aa army of awkward, ungainly skaters.
There la no more graceful or healthful
sport than figure-skating, but there Is
no more awkward sight than an ungain
ly man or woman on skates.
Ice-skating Is such a beautiful and
beneficial sport lhat It has always been
a surprise to me Hist so few hsve taken
It np It le the king of winter sports,
available alike for men. women and
children, and yet a single rtuk In New
York City hss for years been sufficient
to accommodate all those Interested In It
ta the metropolis' Why Is It?
The fart that the New York climate |*
so moderate that there Is seldom more
then a couple of weeks a year of "open"
skating does not answer the question
Indoor skating Is practically as good and
does not depend upon the climate gt all.
Indoor rinks ars available from the be
ginning of November until (he end of
April and afford a full season of splen
did pbyel* el eserc|#c and recreation
Why has the aport been so long neg
(acted?
Whatever the reason, the fact remain*
that s big < bange I* now taking place
The lee dancing fad which Is now asanm
log rich egtenalve proportions, promise-*
le bring Ire skating into Its own. In
door rinks are going to take the pince of
ballrooms and dancehallg. end dansants

Everyone who takes op Ice aketlng I*
bound to tie clumsy and awkward at first.
So one who la familiar with the amount
of patience, persistence Hnd native grace
required to mthe an eapert skater will
aspect a novice to put on skates and be
case a Charlotte tn a day
But leaving beginners out of the ques
tion altogether for the moment, there
are thousands of people who regard
themselves a* pretty good skatere, who
have been skating all their Uvea, who
don't even know that each akate baa two
edges' They don't seem to reallco the
full possibilities of the eport. or, at any
rate, they make no effort to attain them.
That Is unfortunate.
It Is my Intention in thane articles to
explain the fundamental principles of
figure skating and to demonstrate how
anybody may. by following tha correof
methods patiently and persistently, be
come a proficient Ice dancer. Every
woman cannot expect to become a Char
lotte. hut there Is no reason why avery
woman who skates may not be able to
execute all the regular ice dances grace
ful! y and becomingly. If these articles
help to make the path a little easier, they
will have served their purpose.
It Is necessary before taking np figure
skating and dancing to consider some of
the fundamental principles of skating.
Correct skating la out of the question
without the proper equipment. .Expert
skaters hare their Individual preferences
regarding the style of skates and shoe*
which |a best adapted to their work.
With regard to the heat skating boot for
tbs average Individual who Intends to take
up figure ska'tog. I should say that wall

nental skaters. Is now
generally followed In
this country.
These rules of fora
and the series of figures
prescribed by the Inter
national School of Skat
ing are the very best, in
my opinion, for begin
ners in figure skating
to follow. They com
prise a progressive
course which is best
adapted to develop a
figure skater.
The rules of form are
as follows:
1.—Head erect, with
eyes upon the Ice no
more than is absolutely
necessary.
S.—Body uptight, not
bent forward or sidewise
from the hips, shoulders
thrown back and chest
expanded.
I.—Arms, whether ac
tive or passive, should
have free play from the

ten-step, the fourteen-step, the Jackson
Haines, the Rocker Valse. the Mohawk
and the various other Ice dances which
will soon be as familiar in name to the
general public, perhaps, as the turkey
trot, the foi-trot, the tango and the one
step have become.
Before describing the various figures,
it is necessary' to explain what la meant
by the four edgea—the right Inside, the
right outside, the left Inside and the left
outside. As all rurvea must be made on
either one of those four edges, it is es
sential to master them.
Consider first the right foot The out
side edge, known as the "right outside,"
Is. naturally enough, the edge to the right.*
the Inside edge, known as the "right In
side” being the edge to the left. In the
case of- the left foot, the outside edge,
known as the "left outside” Is the edge
to the left, and the Inside edge, known
as the “left Inside” Is the edge to the
right.
Here then we have the four edges. Upon
these edges It Is possible to skate either
forward or backward, thus making eight
different possible strokes, as follows:
Right outside forward, right outside back
w-ard. right Inside forward, right inside
backward, left outside forward, left out
side backward, left inside forward and
left Inside backward.
Kaeh one of these edges will take the
skater In a different direction. The right
outside forward, for Instance, will take
him on a forward curve to the right; the
right Inside forward will take him on a
forward curve to the left, and so on.
r,»< n one oi incse races must be pra©
tlsr<l until It hss been mastered and can
be skated with perfect rontrol. The be
ginner will almost Invariably And that
one foot Is weaker than the other In
that event, the weaker foot must ba
practised on all the more. Do not favor
the leg which you can Control best.
Work the less apt le« the most
In practising the various edges. It It
Just as well for a beginner aot to hgva
the blade of the skate too sharp A
sharp skate Is less easy for a beginnar
to rontrol than one In which the keen
edge is off. If a new pair of skates Is
to be used, therefore. It la wise to de
some straight ahead skating on 'hem
Aral so as to beroma accustomed to
them.
Haring attained tba various edges, both
forward and backward, so that a fair*'

	<text>To the blase, seen-everything, heard
all film capital, Sonja Henje, the
beautiful blonde skating star is an
amazing personality—the Olympics
athlete who came to display her sport
ing prowess became an outstanding
actress, and remained to introduce to
tremendous popularity a new art, the
ice ballet.
Originally the world hailed Sonja as
its champion skater. Triumph after
triumph on the rink culminated in the
1928 Olympics medal. And again in
the 1932 games. And again in 1936.
"Ever since 1 was a little girl I
wanted to be on the stage,” Sonja ex
plains. “1 wanted to put some of the
beauty of the dance into my skating.”
That the modest Sonja has suc
ceeded was never more evident than
on the rink set of her newest 20th
Century-Fox picture, “My Lucky
Star.” Top-notch stars from every
surrounding studio crowded onto the
set to see the filming of her breath
taking ice ballet production of "Alice
In wonderland." Spontaneous ap
plause from those accustomed to re
ceiving it in large doses greeted the
end of each sequence as Sonja led all
the characters of Lewis Carroll’s be
loved story through beautiful gyra
tions incredible to behold.
Directed by Roy Del Ruth and
featuring Richard Greene, Joan
Davis, Cesar Romero and Buddy
Ebsen, "My Lucky Star" will show
Tuesday and Wednesday at the State

	<text>Topeka Kan., Feb. 20. The Oil Pro
ducers' Association has engaged Sena
tor Fitzpatriek and Representatives
Beekman to go to Washington to op
pose the transfer of the Foster leases
in Indian Territory to the Standard Oil
f "mmny. The Kansas delegation in
congress will be asked to oppose the
transfer.
A Topeka special says: The state of
Kansas, with $400,000 and a stiff
backed population, has set about the
task of fighting Standard Oil, with
$400,000,000,000, and tentacles spread
ing all over tho United States and for
eign countries. The battle between the
Sunflower state and the greatest of all
monopolies nnd its ultimate outeomo
will be worth watching.
Back of tho state of Kansas are
powerful influences which have not yot
appeared upon the canvas. The peo
ple of the state have appealed to Thos.
W. Lawson, of Boston, who has already
paid his sarcastic compliments to
Standard Oil, to take the generalship
of the fight, but it is doubtful if he
will accept. However, it is figurod he
may bo relied upon for any friomlly
counsel.
In six days the Kansas legislature
has passed the anti-trust legislatien:
Anti -discrimination bill Aimed at
.standard Oil.
Maximum freight rate bill To pre
vent railroads favoring Standard Oil.
linilroad commission bill To pro
vent Standard Oil dominating stato
railroads.
Stato refinory bill To compote with
Standard Oil.
Anti-gas pumping bill To prevent
use of artificial powor, thus keeping
Kansas gas within her borders.

Throws open oil conduits to all competition.
Delegations of hundreds of stalwart
ami determined men swarmod up to the
state capital today from the oil fields
and positively demanded that tho bill
pass. It is also true that not all of
theso min were oil producers. l"n their
ranks one could see many speculators
men who have invested in "wild
cat" oil schemes. Those men are anx
ious that the stock they purchased at
10 cents on the dollar should become
worth a trille more than the paper up

Washington, Feb. 21. Senator Long
this morning received a telegram from
the president of the Kansas senate and
speaker of the Kansas house of repre
sentatives containing the text of the
concurrent resolution of the Kansas
legislature in regulation to what is
known as the Foster lease in the Osage
Indian reservation declaring against the
extension of the lease.
Senator Long at once called for the
president and secretary of interior and
they informed him that the matter had
been definitely settled and that their
decltion in the matter would not be
changed.
It was stated that an agreement had
been reached between the secretary of

Congressman P. P. Campbell of Kansas Who Has Become Famous for His
Fight on Standard Oil.
Interior and the oil men interested in
the extension of the lease which agree
ment had bean inserted as a provis
ion in the Indian appropriation bill re
ported yesterday to the senate.
The president and secretary of inter
ior were very positive in stating that
this agreement was satisfactory to
them and would be carried out.
The provision is to the effect that
any allottmerts on Osage reservations
in Oklahoma made under the Foster
blanket lease of March 16, 1X96, which
leases and sub-lea.e were executed pri
or December 31. 1904. or executed after
that date based on contracts made
prior thereto and approved by the sec
retary of interior, "To the extent of
680.0'XI acres in the aggregate," are ex
tended for a period of ten years from
March 16, 1906, and provision is also
made for increase on royalty on gas
from $50 to J100 per annum.
Representative P. P. Campbell re
ceived a similar telegram containing
the Fitzpatrick resolution. Mr. Camp
bell also visited the president and later
in the day consulted with Senator Long
in regard to the matter.
Senator Long presented to the senate
today a copy of the concurrent resolu
tion number 21 of the Kansas house of
representatives which he received today
from J. R. Burrow, secretary of state
and which provides that "Our represen
tative in congress be requested and our
senators directed to prepare, urge and
perfect such national legislation as will
control the Standard Oil company and
protect the oil industry in Kansas from
destruction by the greatest monopoly
the world has ever known."
Representative Campbell again visit-
ea tne president today and conferred I
with him further regarding the gov-1
ernmental investigation of standard nil
The president again took occasion to
assure Mr. Campbell and through the
senate of Kansas that investigation
would be most thorough.
The Kansas legislature has taken
another rap at the Standard Oil com
pany. Both houses have adopted a
resolution calling upon our congress
men to prevent the renewal of the
oil leases in the Indian Territory and
to work to annul the Standard's leases.
This is interesting, because it is sup
Posed that at least one member of
the Kansas congressional delegation is
very much concernea m the Indian
Territory oil leases.
The senate Monday afternoon adopt
ed the following resolution presented
by Senator Fitzpatrick:
"Whereas, The Standard Oil company
has a blanket lease for oil and gas of
the Osage Indian reservation, known
as the 'Foster lease,' which, if it con
tinues to hold, will make it able to de
stroy private producers and drive them
out of business; and
"Whereas, The secretary of interior
has declared in public prints that this
lease, which is commonly known as the
Foster lease,' passed into the control
and ownership of the said Standard Oil
company by fraud; and
"Whereas. The secretary of the inter
ior has consented under protest to re
new to the Standard Oil company, o"r
its agents and representatives, the lease
of nearly 700,000 acres of this land; and
"Whereas, The 700,000 acres he has
selected is in the heart and body of the
oil and pas portion of the reservation,
leaving for individual lessees or pur
chasers only pasture land; and
"Whereas, The said 700,000 acres is the
richest portion of the western oil field,
and its continued use and development
by the Standard Oil company would add
to the power of that,company to anni
hilate other production; and
"Whereas, The Standard Oil company
has been declared by public opinion to
be an outlaw, and by its tyrannival prac
tices and unfair competition the enemy
of honest commerce; therefore, be it
"Resolved, By the senate of the state
of Kansas, the house concurring there
in, that the president, the secretary of
interior, and the congress of the Uni
ted States be, and they are hereby re
quested to hold up and annul the said
'Foster lease," in whole, which the sec
retary of interior has declared in pub
lic statement was originally obtained
by fraud.
"Resolved, Further, that copies of
this memorial be telegTaphed by the
president of the state senate, and the
speaker of the house, to the president
of the United States, the secretary of
interior, the president of the senate, the
speaker of the house, the Hon. Chester
I. Long and the Hon. P. P. Campbell;
and that Senator Long and Representa
tive Campbell give it as wide publicity
as possible.
"Resolved, Further, especially ad
dressing the Kansas delegation in con
gress, that this is a contest of the hon
est industry of the land against insolent
greed and commercial out-lawry, and it
is the duty of all men who hold offi?e
by the suffrage of the people of Kansas
to help in a war which their state ha3
first declared by legislative action."

Senators Benedict, Samuel Porter and
Noftzger opposed the. resolution on the
ground that the statements made could
not be substantiated. This brought Sena
tor Fitzpatrick to the defense of the res
olution and in a lengthy speech he gave
the history of the "Foster lease."
He told of the round about way in which
the Standard Oil secured the blanket
lease on the 700.000 acres of oil lands in the
Osage reservation.
"The senators here who have spoken
about this 'Foster lease' know whom I
speak of when I refer to "the gentleman
from Wisconsin,' and I get it from this
gentleman from Wisconsin that he had
made arrangements to enlist every promi
nent politician in the interests of the In
dian Territory Illuminating Oil company
to secure a rowan! of that lease," said
Senator Fitzpatrick In part. "Those who
have been in Washington have been there
in the intcreMs of this company.
"With a weapon, such as 700.000 acres of
blanket leased oil lands, the Standard Oil
will he able to supply th.s countrv and
the world with oil and it will be impos
sible for any independent refinery to sur
vive against those who own the refineries,
the pi;e lines, the cars and such a lease.
When the people of this country are ris
ing up in every town and village to ask
that this monster be crushed, then for the
government to step in and lease a reser
voir of 700.000 acres of oil. is something the
government will not knowinglv do."
Senator Smith, from Franklin, explain
ed his vote against the resolution by say
ing that the style of literature in the res
olution reminded him of a heated cam
paign speech, and he was opposed to the
language and not to the resolution.
The Fitzpatrick resolution concern
ing the Foster lease was sent imme
diately to the house and there it was
passed by a unanimous vote. The
memorial was telegraphed to Wash
ington, to the officials named in the
resolution, last night at a cost of $65.

Expresses Accord With Effort

Springfield, 111., Feb. 21. The house
today adopted two resolutions affect
ing the Standard Oil company. One
offered by Representative Allen offers
to loan the state of Kansas the sum
of J 100,000 without interest for a
period of six years to aid in establish
ing a state oil refinery and refers to
the Standard Oil company as that
"merciless octopus, whose tentacles
now encircle every state in the union."
The resolution was adopted by a close
viva voce vote amid considerable con
fusion and laughter.
A resolution by Representative Mc
Goorty of Chicago asks for an investi
gation of the laying of pipe lines
through Illinois by the Standard Oil
company and provides for the appoint
ment of a joint committee to confer
with the state officers of Kansas to
agree on steps to be taken toward de
claring such pipe lines common car
riers. This resolution was adopted
without a dissenting vote. Mr. Allen
is a Republican and Mr. McGoorty a
uemocrat.
The McGoorty resolution declares the
present house to be in hearty accord
with the fight of the Kansas legislature
for commercial freedom.
Representative McGoorty explained
when the resolution was introduced
that it was not intended to make any
investigation of the Standard Oil com
pany. "I merely want an investigation of
the pipe line which now extends to
Galesburg and Monmouth," he said.
"This, pipe line later extended to In
diana. If necessary the report of the
committee .appointed may be followed
by a bill to make the company a com
mon carrier and subject to the same
regulations and penalties."
The text of the resolution is as fol
lows: "Whereas, The state of Kansas,
through its legislature and chief execu
tive has taken steps and adopted meas
ures to provide against the aggression
of the Standard Oil company.
"Whereas, Kansas has become a great
oil producing state and under proper
enabling legislation purposes to supply
to the consumer oil and its bi-products
in defiance of threats of extermination
and ruin, reported to have been made
against said state by Standard Oil com
pany, and
"Whereas, In this regard the assertion
by Kansas of her rights and powers as
a sovereign state of this union, has
awakened the hope that this most me
nacing of all combinations is amenable
to the law of the land, and
"Whereas, It is reported that pipe lines
and conduits controlled by the Standard
Oil company, extending from the oil fields
of Kansas to certain cities of the state of
Illinois intend to supply oil to such cities
are rapidly apiroaching completion and
that such pipe lines are proposed to ex
tend across the state to its eastern boun
darv; and,
"Whereas, The people of this state have
the right to know and be fully advised as
to the purpose of the Standard Oil com
pany In this regard and under what rights
and terms it may claim as a common car
rier or in any other capacity; now, there
fore, be It
"Resolved. By he house of representa
tives of the general assembly of Illinois,

purpose of conferring and communicating

Senator Carmack Arouses Mirth
of the Senate.
While the House Railroad Bill
Is Laid to Rest.
Washington, Feb. 21. When the
senate convened today Mr. Carmack,
a member of the committee on inter
state commerce, presented a petition
for railroad rate legislation. Mr,
Berry immediately asked as to the
prospect for railroad rate legislation.
Mr. Carmack gave place to Mr. Elkins,
chairman of the committee, to make
reply. Mr. Elkins said:
"The bill passed by the house
reached the senate about ten days ago,
During that time the senate has had
almost continuous sessions, but only
one friend of the railroads has been
heard. The committee has given the
best attention possible to the bill, but
there has been no time to consider
the amendments and there are several
believed to be important. No decision
as to an effort to pass the bill this
session has been reached, but with
the limited time at their disposal it
would seem tnat mere is very little
prospect of that result before adjourn
ment with only ten days of the session
left and with much other imperative
business to be performed. It would
hardly seem probable that the most
important economic question of the
day could be disposed of in so short a
time, and especially In view of the
fact that only one side of the question
has so far been presented, to the com
mittee." Mr. Carmack, a member of the
committee on the interstate commerce,
excused himself from speaking before
the committee on the ground that
such joyous harmony exists there as to
obliterate party lines. He said he
could assure the senate that all of the
committee are actuated hy a keen de
sire to fulfill at the earliest possible
moment the promises made by the
president of the United States and
through the medium of the Demo
cratic platform and to add "that it is
the intention of the whole committee
to be guided in this , matter by the
president.
"Indeed," he added, "I may go far
ther and say, knowing the chairman
of the committee will correct me if I
am wrong, that I anjvauthorized to in
form the senate that all the members
recognize in the president the foremost
disciple and the ablest lieutenant of
William J. Bryan."
The statement caused a general
burst of laughter and the incident
closed.

Washington, Feb., 21. No report
will be made in the Senator Smoot
case during the present congress. This
has been agreed upon by several mem
bers of the senate committee on privi
leges and elections, for the reason that
time does not remain for consideration
by the senate of such report as the
committee might make. Senators
Spooner, Hale, Piatt (Conn.) and sev
eral other senators as well as mem
bers of the committee desire to dis

William T. Leahy Says They Don't
Want Foster Lease.
Washington. Feb. 21. William T.
Leahy, a member of the council of the
Osage Indian tribe, in a statement
given out today, says the Indians are
opposed to the renewal of the oil lease
on their lands upon the existing terms
and are protesting against a renewal.
The original lease given to E. B. Fos
ter for a period of ten years, the state
ment says, was approved contrary to
the wishes of the Indians. The state
ment asks that the president have an
investigation made to disclose all of
the facts; that those for whom it
speaks have been obliged to fight their
battle alone and that they have been
unable to secure the consent to em
ploy assistance which can be done
only with the approval of the depart

READYFOR IT.
Railroad Bill in the Senate
, Tomorrow.
Fate of the GarTer BUI in
Balance.
ROADS MAY WIN IT.
Now Looks as If They Hare
Upper Hand.
Great Influence Exerted " to De
feat Shippers.
The railroads are exerting stren
uous efforts to block the passage of
tne liarver railroad bill in the senate,
and it now looks as though they may
triumph. The Garver bill passed the
house unanimously by the overwhelm
ing vote of 112 to 0. It comes up in
the senate tomorrow afternoon.
Every means within the power of
the railroads has been brought to bear
on this question. Reports received
in Topeka state that the railroads have
instructed the station agents at all sta
tions in Kansas to secure signers to
petitions urging the senators not to
pass the Garver bill. - Pass holders
in all parts of the state are urged to
do the same work of securing peti
tions. The railroads with their telegraph
service to every nook and corner of
the state are using the telegraph lines
to the best possible advantage.
A copy of a telegram which the
railroad interests are having sent to
Senator Porter from Independence and
vicinity has been received in Topeka
today. The telegram reads:
"Col. S. M. Porter, senator. Topeka,
Kansas: Believe shippers and railroads
can adjust the rate question without
commissioners mixing in and hope you
will vote against the bill."
It is asserted that the railroads are
coercing and intimidating all persons
whom they can intosendingsimilar tele
grams to the senators in Topeka.
The telegraph service being controll
ed by the same interests, vast quanti
ties of tetegraphic dispatches may be
transmitted at no cost to the senders.
Of the four principal railroads operat
ing in Kansas, three are either partly
or entirely controlled by the Standard
Oil party, or Rockefeller and his asso
ciates, as well as the commercial tele
graph lines.
By pooling all interests, tremendous
power is being wielded to defeat the
wishes of the shippers, and through
them the people of Kansas.
Feeling in regard to the passage of
the raliway rate regulation has reach
ed a high point. . The feeling on beth
sides is intense and ugly charges are
being made. - '
It is asserted that the railroads
have never been so liberal with passes
as they have been during this session
of the legislature. In addition to the
annual passes with which every mem
ber is supplied, the railroads have not
restricted the giving of trip passes. In
this manner hundreds and hundreds
of free passes have been distributed.
At the Santa Fe offices there has
been almost a continual procession of
messengers, pages and others with re
quests for passes from the members
and not a few members themselves
have been in line. The same liberal
feeling has prevailed at the other
railroad offices. No doubt the Santa
Fe has been more liberal than other
roads inasmuch as the Santa Fe has
assumed the burden of the present
fight.
The shippers declare that the en
actment of the Smith bill will leave
them in a worse condition than they
are at present under the present rail
way law.
Discrepancy In Kates.
Wide discrepancies between local
and through rates, made by the rail
roads, introduces a subject which
railway officials find hard- to explain. -Recently
the major portion of the
corn crop of the state of Nebraska
was moved, a portion to New Orleans
on the Gulf of Mexico, and the re
mainder more than half way across
the continent to Baltimore on the At
lantic ocean for less per hundred j
pounds than is charged for hauling
the same kind of grain less than half
way across the state of Kansas.
The grain situation in Iowa and Ne
braska has brought to light some
phases that is of particular interest to
the people of the state of Kansas at
this time, while the railway rate regu
lation matter is pending in the legis
lature. The Chicago Daily Tribune says:
Railroad officials, who have their
eves on the legislatures of western
states now in session, are in serious
alarm lest action be taken to reduce
local rates to the same basis as the
prevailing through rates on grain.
At present there is a wide discrep
ancy between rates fixed by the states
and the charges on tnrougn snip
ments. Under the strict mileage law
of Iowa, it costs from 12 to 14 cents
per hundred pounds to ship corn from
the Missouri to the Mississippi river.
The same grain will be carried to Bal
timore for export at 11 cents, or to
Chicago for 8 cents. Of late several
officials have been called before legis
tive committees ' for their testimony,
and in every instance this wide dis
crepancy has been inquired into. It is
claimed that if the railroads . can
carry corn and oats from Omaha to
Baltimore at 11 cents it ought to be
possible for them to carry grain across
the state of Iowa for less than the
charges now fixed by the state law.
"This wide difference between state
and interstate rates is going to get the
railroads into trouble on their local
business," said an official yesterday,
who had just returned from a, trip to
a western legislature.
Railway officials have a score or more
of arguments which they always pre
sent in a suave manner to show why
rates are never too high.
When one line or argument fails an
other line of argument is ready at.
once. One railway official will say that
the railroads made the extremely low
rate on corn from Nebraska across the
continent to Baltimore for the reason
that it had to be done to influence other
business. The absurdity of such an "ar
gument is apparent to all. The amount
of corn which was moved out of Ne
braska on the eleven cent rate is con
servatively estimated in the neighbor
hood of five millions of bushels, and
there is no one who believes that any
railroad will haul five millions of bush
els of corn at a loss.
Recently the newspapers printed thei
following list of reduced rates on ex
port corn on the basis of 100 pounds:
Omaha to Baltimore, 11 cents.
Omaha to New Orleans, 11 cents.
Kansas City to New Orleans, 10 cents.
Omaha to Memphis, 10 cents.
Omaha to Little Rock, 10 cents.
Omaha to St. Louis, 5 cents.
Railway officials will have a hard
time convincing Kansas shippers that
12 to 15 cents per hundred pounds is a
fair rate on grain from central Kansas
points to the Missouri river if the roads
canafford to haul grain from Omaha
to St. Louis for five cents per hundred
pounds.
It is claimed that if the railroads can
carry corn and oats from Omaha to Bal
timore at 11 cents it ought to be possi
ble for them to carry those commodities
across the state of Kansas for less than
the charges now fixed and collected by
the railroads.
DOUBLE PIER BURNS.
Loss of a Million Dollars at Iloosac
Tunnel Docks.
Boston, Feb. 21. A large double pier,
Nos. 3 and 4, of the Hoosac tunnel docks
in Charlestown, together with considera
ble valuable freight, was completely de
stroyed by fire early today and the steam
er Philadelphia of the Furness-Leyland
line, from which the- crew fled so hastily
that two were injured, was hauled into
the stream with her upper works ablaze
The loss to the Boston and Maine Rail
road company, the owners of the docks, is
estimated at fully $400..0u0, while the dam
age to the Philadeiphian will, it is
thought, bring the loss up to about a mil
lion dollars. The adjoining pier. No. 5,
which was burned last November and
which was being rebuilt, was slightly
damaged, while the steamer Dalton Hall,
on the opposite side of the pier from the
Philadeiphian, backed out under her own
steam, practically uninjured. .
Chief Steward Fellows of the Philadei
phian jumped overboard and was rescued
in an exhausted condition, while one of
the firemen of the steamer jumped to the
deck of a nearby lighter and had a leg
broken. Captain Dickinson and his wife
was taken oft by the tire boat.
The fire started, presumably, from spon
taneous combustion in some hay on pier
No. 4.
Chief Steward Fellows of the Philadei
phian was taken to a hospital, where he
was pronounced to be in a dangerous con
dition. Four others, including two fire
men, were taken to the hospital, but will
recover.
Within five minutes after the fire was
discovered fully a quarter of an acre of
covered pier, well filled with the most in
flammable goods, was wrapped In flames.
Blazing brands were carried across the
harbor to thq city proper, but fortunately
away from a large grain elevator at the
head of pier No. 4. The Philadeiphian,
which arrived last Saturday from Liver
pool and had discharged about a quarter
of her cargo, caught fire within a few mo
ments. Her crew, who rushed on deck at
the first alarm, were driven over the side
by the great volume of flame tltat poured
across the decks. But few harbor tugs
were in the neighborhood and it was near
ly an hour before she was hauled from
her perilous position. At daylight the fire
was under control.
DIGGING THEM OUT.
Over 100 Miners Entombed by an Ex
plosion in Alabama.
Birmingham, Ala., Feb. 21. E. T.
Schuyler, one of the owners of the Vir
ginia mines, where more than 100
miners were imprisoned yesterday af
ternoon by an explosion was advised
this morning that the rescuers were
close to the entombed men and that one
body had been found and removed.
Schuyler thinks there is a good chance
for a number of the miners to be .found
alive, as he says the air shaft into the
mine is working. The rescue parties
worked all night and were augmented
by miners from various mines in the
district.
By an explosion in the Virginia mine,
about 18 miles southwest of Birming
ham, more than a hundred union
miners are entombed.
The explosion is believed to have
been caused by an accumulation of
dust, although the mine has heretofore
been noted for being entirely free from
dust.
The company is almost isolated from
the rest of the world as there is no tel
ephone station at Virginia and the only
wire running to the place is a dispatch
er's w-ire of the Birmingham Mineral
railway, on which Virginia is located.

NO REST FOR
BEtf TRUST.
A Special Grand Jury Is Called
by Federal Court.
For Purpose of Indicting the
Packing House Men.
MARSHALS ARE OUT.
With Subpoenas for "Witnesses
Against Members of Big Four.
Violation of Judge Grosscup's
Injunction Is Alleged.
Chicago, Feb. 21. The first step lead
ing to the possible indictment of mem
bers of the alleged "beef trust" was
taken here today. A special grand Jury
venire was ordered drawn and deputy
United Statea marshals were sent out
with subpoenas for witnesses against
members of the alleged trust. Indict
ments will be sought on charges of di
rect violation of an injunction issued
some time ago, by Judge Grosscup, of
the United States circuit court, restrain
ing members of the alleged beef trust
from illegal combination in restraint of
Interstate commerce.
The decision of Judge Grosscup waa
recently sustained by the United Statea
supreme court. Much secrecy waa
maintained concerning the affair and
the deputy marshals were dispatched
under orders to serve the subpoenas im
mediately and to make public no facta
concerning the affair.
For more than eight months investi
gation has been carried on secretly in
Chicago. Orders came from Attornesi
General Moody to United States Dis
trict Attorney Bethea to take up wor
on the case.
Attorney Bethea was twice ordered ta
Washington to receive instructions in
the matter and he was once accom
panied by United States Marshal Ames.
Bethea was ordered to place competent
men on the investigation and to epara
no expense to secure evidence against
violators of the injunction of Judg
Grosscup.
The men who were restrained by
Judge Grosscup'1? decision in the beef
case were J. Ogden Armour, Kdward
Morris, Ira Morris, Arthur Meeker,
Charles V. Langdon, Edward A. Cuda
hy, Louis F. Swift, D. Edwin Hartwell,
Frank E. Vogel, William Russell, Kd
ward C. Swift, W. H. Noyes, Nelson
Morris, Patrick A. Valentine, Calvin M.
Favorite, Thomas J. Connors, Michal
Cudahy, Albert F. Boohert, Lawrence
A. Carter, Jesse P. .. Lyman, Louis
Pfalsear, Albert H. WeddeT'and Ferdin
and Sulzberger. - .-
More than 100 witnesses will be sum
moned to testify concerning the op
erations of the packers. It is believed
the investigation of the special grand
jury will cover several weeks.
In all 185 subpoenas were issued. They
are for subordinates, clerks and other
employes Of packers. None of the
packers was summoned. The employes
are expected to corroborate by their
testimony secured by government se
cret agents. The men subpoenaed live
in 15 different cities. Until service is
secured it is probable their names will
not bw made public.
The principal cities where papers
are to be served besides Chicago are;
St. Paul, Minneapolis, Philadelphia,
Boston. Brooklyn. New York, Jersey
City, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Omaha, SU
Louis and New Orleans.
AFTER OTHER TIU'STS.
Beef, Grain, Implement, Milling and
Others May Be Investigated.
Senator F. Dumont Smith intro-
duced the following resolution at this
morning's session of the senate:
"Whereas, A memorial has been
presented to the president and by the
president to James R. Garfield, com
missioner of corporations for investi
gation, charging the Standard Oil com
pany with unfair competition and un
lawful combinations in Kansas: and.
"Whereas. It is publicly charged all
over the state in the newspapers not
only that the Standard Oil company,
but the Beef trust, the Grain trust,
the Implement trust, the Milling
trust, the Lumber trust and other com
binations hurtful to fair competition
are practicing piracy upon the public;
and,
"Whereas, The people of the coun
try have risen in righteous indignation
and are demanding legislation that
will prevent and punish monopolistic
combinations: therefore, he it
"Resolved by the senate, the house
concurring therein, that a committee
of one senator and two representa-.
fives be appointed by the legislature,
the senator by the president of tha
senate and the representatives by tha
speaker of the house, for the purpose
of investigating all such charges and
recommending remedial legislation;
and,
"Resolved, That this committee shall
have a stenographer and a sergeant-at-arms,
and it shall have power to
summon witnesses and send for books
and papers; and
"Resolved, That after the committee
shall have organized by electing one of
its members to be chairman and one
to be clerk and appointing a steno
grapher and a sergeant-at-arms, after
the adjournment of this legislature it
shall appoint times for its sessions
and shall give notice to the public
through the newspapers of the same;
and
"Resolved, That upon the conclu
sion of its inquiries, which shall be be
fore January 1, 1906, the committee
shall make a summary of the evidence
taken by it and prepare its recom
mendations, which shall be filed with
the governor and given to the news
papers fgr publication before March 1,
1906."
The purpose of the resolution Is for
Kansas to secure directly the evidence
concerning these trusts. The national
bureau of commerce, at the direction
of President Roosevelt, is to make In
vestigations In Kansas. If Kansas has
a commission It can work with the
government officials and secure evi
dence Stid information which will aid
the next legislature in passing trust
legislation.

LOOK OUT FOR POLICE.
One of the most astonishing things Special Officers Sworn In to Take Care
revealed by the Interrogatories is the
fact that the Standard OH company of
Kansas, with 11.000,000 capital, has paid
32,233,300 in dividends, while the Stand
ard Oil of Indiana, which is the big
clearing house for the retail profits,
with only $1,000,000 capital, has in less
than seven years paid over $50,000,000
In dividends.
The answers of the Standard Oil of
Kansas show that the 10,000 shares of
stock in that company are owned as
follows: H. M. Flagler, 6,000 shares;
James A. Moffett. 8993. shares; A. M.

The President in a Special Message

STATES IT IN SECOND MESSAGE
We ixek to control lawdefying wealth in the first place to prevent its
doing dire evil to tho Republic and In tho next place to avoid tho vindictive
and dreadful radicalism which If lert uncontrolled It Is certain In tho end
to arouse
Sweeping attacks upon all property upon all men of means without re
gard to whether they do well or 111 would sound the death knell of the Re
public and such atucks became Inevitable If decent citizens permit those rich
men whose lives are corrupt and evil to domineer In swollen pride unchecked
and unhindered over the destinies of this country
We act in no vindictive spirit and we are no respecter of persons If a
labor union does wrong we oppose It as firmly as we oppose a corporation
which doc wrong and twe stand equally stoutly for the rights of the man of
wealth and for tho rlchts of the waco worker
We sock to protect the property of every man who nets honestly of every
corporation that represents wealth honestly accumulated and honestly used
We seek to stop wrongdoing and we desire to punish the wrongdoers only as
far as Is necessary to achieve this end
I Special to The Evening World
I WASHINGTON Jan 31President Roosevelt sent a special mes
sage to Congress today which is quite the hottest state document he
V ever penned
< It is in effect a defense of his administration with respect to his cam
picn against corporations And there are some who will find in it an
ack upon the Supreme Court of the United States
I Never tcfore has he been so bitter in attacking malefactors of great
b wealth He jumps on the Standard Oil Company in vigorous fashion
takes a fall out of tricky corporation lawyers and compares men who bribe
J Matures and illegally manipulate corporations for their own profit to
the leeche who fatten upon blood money from dens of vice gambling
houses and saloons
It is plain to be seen That the Presidents message is an answer to
the broadside campaign of abuse that has been heaped upon him by ad
vertisement and pamphlet since he instigated corporation prosecutions
He stands pat on his record promises further action and eternally lam
tastes his enemies He practically accuses the Standard Oil Company
and certain railroad interests with instigating these attacks
The President disclaims any responsibility for
the panic of last fall and the resulting hard times
lIe blames it upon the speculative folly and flagrant
dishonesty of a few men of great wealth who seek to
shield themselves from the effects of their own
wrongdoing by ascribing its results to the actions of
those who have sought to put a stop to the wrong
doing
In his message the President repeats much that he has said in for
mer messages and in his public speeches but on no previous occasion
has he cut loose with such freedom and vigor It is a message that is
sure to arouse a storm of comment and every citizen who takes the
slightest interest in business or politics should read it carefully</text>

DEFENDS STANDARD OIL.
Milburn Denies Fraud and Coercion In
Buying Up Rival·.
St. Louie, April 8.—John G. Mil
burn, seulor counsel of the Standard
Oil company iu the suit of the gov
ernment to have the great corpora
tion dissolved as a violator of the
Sherman act, now being argued before
the full bem^ûf the United States cir
cuit court here, resumed his argu
ment for the defense.
Mr. Milburn denied that there had
been either fraud, coercion or wrong
in the acquisition of the properties
bought by Standard Oil.
"In the general economy of society,"
he said, "it was ordained that some
men should succeed and others fall.
Some man failed in the oil refining
business. They could not keep pace
with the improvements of time. They
came to us to sell, and we bought.
"Is this defendant to be charged
with that mau's failure to succeed7
Did we coinyaps his fall? No; such Is
the law of progress."</text>

	<text>Brother Boyles, of the Oil City
Derrick, is all worked up over the
last chapter of Ida Tarbell's his
tory of the Standard Oil com
pany. He is writing long editor
ials each day about the matter.
He has not yet reached that part
of her interesting history where
Bro. Boyles acknowledges in
writing he had been grossly lying
and slandering the independent
producers. We call attention to
this for fear our dear brother
might overlook this one little
item of Miss Tarbell's historv.
I , *
Bwyles ought to acknowledge
Miss Tarbell's gentle and
lady-like answer to his many
columns of blackguardism pub
lished, admit she has given
him a solar plexus blow and tell
his readers why the honest Stand
ard Oil company will not issue
West Virginia producers certifi
cates for his oil and why the price
of oil goes dowii when the demand
for refined is using up the daily
production and a great deal more.
Instead of Boyles writing about
ancient history of the way the
Standard used its power to kill off
opposition, which it did, he
ought to get down to late history
and tell us why it is honest for
"common carriers" to refuse to
give a receipt for the oil it carries
and is paid for conveying as the
Standard has recently done in re
fusing to give producers certifi
cates for their oil. The Standard
did do this, we all know it did,
and if Boyles can explain how or
where this is honest we want to
know how it is.</text>

	<text>THE EIFFEL TOWER
A Msht and Sensation for lisitor to
1arls
In view of the assurance of a
creditable representation of Hawaii
both in productions and person
agesat the Universal Exhibition of
this year in Paris a few facts rela
tive to the EiffeUower culled from
a late English paper may be of local
interest
The tower is named after its pro
jector Mr Eiffel now President of
the French Association of Engineers
He is famed in part -for the design
ing of a great bridge at Bordeaux
Although the Eiffel tower was orig
inally the conception mainly of an
ambition likened to that of Ameri
cans by the English paper referred
to for having the highest structure
in the world it was also early as
sumed that it would have uses in the
interest of science It is claimed
and anticipated that it will be very
raluable for observatory purposes
owing to the perfect clearness of the
air at its summit
The tower is to be one thousand
feet in height At the date of the
description here drawn upon it had
attained an altitude of 738 feet or
162 feet higher than any other build
ing on earth There were 180 men
employed then in its construction
100 preparing the lifts at the base
and 80 riveting the perfectly fitted
parts at top To avoid fatiguing the
workmen aloft in descending several
times a day for food a restaurant is
fitted up at a height of about 400
feet There are to bo four perman
ent restaurants for the refreshment
of visitors on the first stage of the
tower
A spiral stairway runs from the
ground to the summit of the tower
but it is believed that few if any in
experienced heads will be able to en
dure the strain of going round and
round or looking down from the
giddy heights Therefore there are
to be mechanical lifts to the top
four to the first stage two to the
second and thence one to the sum
mit the crown of observation The
final lift will have a capacity of 65
persons I1 ares will be 6 francs to
the first stage and 5 francs to the
top to be reduced on Sundays to 1
franc and 3 francs respectively No
visitors are allowed during construc
tion except on Sundays owing to
danger of accident from a hammer
or bolt falling from aloft Mr iffol
pays a weekly visit to thoworks The
workmeu have to endure severe cold
at the summit whore the thermome
ter sometimes registers several de
grees below zero
The panoramic view to be obtained
of the beautiful city of Paris and
environs froin the top of the Eiffel
tower must be loft to the readers
imagination until assisted by ac
counts from the Hawaiian Commis
sioners Col Spalding and Hon J
A Cummins or unofficial visitors

The Great Eiffel Tower at the
Paris Exposition.
How the Colossal Structure, Just
Completed, was Erected.
The great Eiffel tower at the Paris Exhi
bition has just been completed, and a de
scription of the colossal structure, with an
account of the way it was built, and a sketch
of its constructor, will bo appropriate at this
time. It is scarcely necessary to say that the

The Eiffel Tower,

Pyramid,

Eiffel tower is by far the highest structure in
the world. It presents a decidedly unique ap
pearance, too in general outline not unlike a
stack of four gigantic muskets with their
butts well and solidly spread and their bay
onets joining at their tips.
The Eiffel tower stands in the Champ de
Mars, almost on the left bank of the river
Seine, just in the rear of the Quai d'Orsay,
and in fact a part of its foundation is sunk
through an old arm of the river, which lias
been filled in these many years. Its base
covers a plot of ground 328 feet square, or
nearly two and a half acres in extent.
GUSTAVF. EIFFEL. . .
It Ls really at the base a group of four tow
ers, each nearly fifty feet square, placed at
the corners of the plot of ground, and in
clining toward each other as they rise at an
angle of fifty-four degrees. Each tower con
sists of four columns, bound together by
trusswork, and each column rests on a
masonry pier which is so built that the weight
of the column rests upon it squarely and not
at an ancle.
As the tower is 0S4 feet high. . it will be
seen that the matter of providing a solid
foundation was one of great importance.
There was a lot of boring and digging befon
the spot upon which the tower stands was
finally selected.
The foundation rests upon a thick stratum
of sand and gravel. It may be well to say.
for the benefit of those who think sand is a
rather treacherous sort f ground, that a bed
of sand and gravel, away under ground, is
pretty solid stuff. One of the towers of the
Brooklyn Bridge rests on that sort of base.
The foundations of the two piers of the Eiffel
tower farthest from the Seine rest on sand
and gravel about twenty-five feet below the
surface of the ground. These foundations
were laid in open excavations, and consist
first of great solid platforms of beton, six
feet thick, and next of four stone piers which
rise to the surface to receive the iron col
umns. The foundations for the two piers nearest
the river were not so easily laid. It was
necessary to go thirty-five feet below the
surface of the ground, end this was sixteen
feet under water. So caissons had to be
used, as they were in building the Brooklyn
Bridge piers.
A caisson is in effect simply an enormous
iron box, without any cover, turned upside
down. The method of using it is to dig the
earth out from under it and allow it to
gradually settle as the excavation pro
gresses, meanwhile building the pier on top.
When the required depth is reached the cais
a .n itself is filled up with the beton, and it
forms the bottom layer of it a foundation.
A shaft is left running through the pier
auove for entrance and exit as the work goes
on, and the air in the caisson and shaft is
compressed to whatever is necessary to keep
the water out of the bottom. It is the prin
ciple of the diving bell modified.
Work on the foundations was begun on
January 28, 1887, and at the end of June they
were completed. Then began the labor of
setting up the innumerable pieces of iron of
which the tower is composed, and it went on
at a vapid rate, for each individual piece
came from the works of M. Eiffel, at Leval-lois-Pere
cut to its exact dimensions, fitted
and drilled, so that no modification was neces
sary at the place of operations. Up to a
height of about fifty feet the workmen re
quired no scaffolding to work upon, as each
pier supported itself, although each leaned
toward the others. Then an artificial support
had to le provided, as above that height, un
til the first platform was reached, the center
of gravity of each pier would fall outside of
the base.
And so piece by piece the towers grew,
and at length reached a height of 140 feet.
Then four enormous horizontal trusses were
put in place to connect the four piers. These
were nearly 140 feet long and weighed a
good many tons, and hi order to place them
in position it was necessary to erect an ex
tensive false work, or scaffolding. "When
these trusses were in position, and the con
necting beams to form a flooring were in
place, the workmen ha1 a great solid plat
form, nearly 15U feet above the ground and
upward of 1 oJ feet square, to work upon.
These four inclined piers and the four big
connecting trusses form the solid groundwork
of the tower. There is nothing particularly
unique in the detail of construction. The
work is simply a system of trusses and braces,
in which the material is so placwd as to make
a strong and light structure. The four great
arches which rise between the piers, imme
diately under the great horizontal trusses,
are largely ornamental in character. They
serve to round off what would otherwise be
an angular outline, but do not support any of
the weight of the structure.
Above the lower platform two four-corner
piers incline toward each other at a
sharper angle. The iron columns are lighter
and the spaces in the system of bracing are
larger. High above the first platform, nearly
400 feet from the ground, a second series of
horizontal trusses binds the four piers to
gether and forms the basis for a second land
ing. These two platforms are glorious places

from which to view the city of Paris. They
are so large that even very timid persons
standing on them will lose all fear. The
lower one is nearly half an acre in extent
while the upper one is about one-third that
size. From the platform a view of the coun
try for forty miles around may be obtained.
Above the second platform the four corner
piers gradually approach each other and at
length unite in one pier, at the top of which,
nearty a fifth of a mile from the ground,
there is a covered observatory, and above
this rises a slender mast. Doubtless many
thousand people will see Paris and ever so many
square miles of surrounding country from the
observatory during the summer. They will
not have to walk up, for a gigantic elevator
runs up through one of the piers to the very
top. This elevator is of peculiar construction,
for the carriage or truck, travels upward on
a spiral track, while the car itself rises
vertically, or rather as nearly vertically as
the angle of the pier will allow.
While the Eiffel tower was a stupendous
conception, and will stand as completed
the marvel of modern engineering, no new
principles are involved in its construction.
In fact, to an engineer, the most wonderful
thing about the tower is its simplicity. The
way for the Eiffel tower, both in conception
and execution, was paved, after a fashion,
by the work on the Garobit viaduct and the
Taraes bridge, both of which were built by
Eiffel. In fact, the construction of bridges
and viaducts, without the use of scaffolding or
false work, by making the several parts
balance themselves as the work progresses,
owes much to this French engineer.
Gustavo Eiffel is a master of construction.
It is said of him that he combines within
himself the practical knowledge of the Eng
lish engineer, the audacity of the American
and the science and theories of the French
man. He was born at Dijon, France, in 1S32,
and was educated at the Central School of
Sciences and Arts. He it was who first made
practical use of compressed ah in cassions in
the building of bridge foundations, in the
erection of the great bridge at Bordeaux.
TOP OF THE TOWER.
M. Eiffel has been a busy man, indeed, these
many years, but he found time, when the
statue of Liberty Enlightening the World was
to be set up in New ork Harbor, to design
the skeleton framework which support the
gigantic figure and at the same time firmly
holds it to the granite pier on which it stands.
A glance at the illustration will show to
what extent the Eiffel tower overshadows all
the famous tall structures of the world. In
comparison with its 984 feet Cheops is dwarfed
at 40. The Washington Monument is little
less than 500 feet high, and the point of .he
flame of Liberty's torch in New- York Harbor
rises barely 300 feet in the air.
The fees for ascending the Eiffel tower are
five francs (1) to the cop, three francs
(sixty cents) to the second platform an 1 two
francs (forty cents) t. the first. The three
platforms will hold 10,900 people.</text>

	<text>BASE OF EIFFEL TOWER,
ia tho middlo, and is surrounded by build
ings containing exhibitions of flue arts,
boUos lettres, tho liberal arts, and various
departments of industry.
Those buildings stand on parallel lines and
ore crossed in their axis by a high gallery
manaounted by a doma which leads to th
hatt of machinery. Tho cost of tho build
ings in tho Champs do Mars, exclusivo of tho
Mffel tower, has been about (4,000,000, and
it is intended that they shall remain as per
aaaent structures. The total outlay author
ised for tho entire exposition U 38,600,000, of
wttch $000,000 is hold aa a rcerve fund.
The earthworks required a removal of
700,000 cubic foot. Tke drains and water
pipes of the Camps do Mars were lengthened
hf about two miles, and more than 40,009
ems of iron and steel wero u&ed by the
holders. The hall of machinery is 1,309 feet
long and 150 feet high, covered with a roof
f iron, wood and glass, having a span of
380 feet in tho clear, the greatest ever at
tempted. A gullory extends around tke in
terior for the display of tho lighter classes of
machinery and from end to end run four un
ferofcen linos of shafting for distributing the
Beotivo power. Tho powor is dorived from a
proup of steam engines placed in one of
the touts, tho bollors of which transform
into steam forty tons of wator per hour.
The total energy is about 400 horse power.
TJio chief architectural feature of the ex
position is, of course, tho Eiffel tower, as
wore the Crystal Palace at London In 1851,
the iron lighthouse at Paris in 1807, tho groat
THE EIFFEL TOWZ& VBOX THE BEINK
rotunda at Vionna in 1873, and the Trocadero
palace at Paris in 1878. This is the loftiest
structure eyer rahedjjy Iman, being about
064 feet high. The Washington monumont
now stands second, 55.5 feet. The Cologno
cathedral is 501 feot. Tho tower of Babol
was probably CS0 high. Moro than 7,000
tons of metal were us?d in building tho
Eiffel tower. Tho first sod was turned in
excavation for its foundation on January
28, 1887, and the whole work was completed
on March 31, 1889.
Another interesting feature is found in
the gardens. Hitherto in tho Champs de
Mars the visitor saw only a dusty desert.
Now every bit not covered with buildings is
a charming park with tho greenest of lawns,
, flourished, Minded paths, masses of shrub-
bery. Moro than two years ago, before any
! of tho work of buildina was begun. M.
Alphand, tho dirootor of public works, com
pleted his plans, and traced on tho ground a
detailed map of the garden trees. Shrubs
were then plantod and seeds laid, and now
the whole expanso looks liko a well-kept
park of many years standing. Indeed, the
abundance of vegetation on tho streets and
squares is one of the most striking charac
teristics of all Paris.
During tho progress of the exposition
there will be held at Parl3 numerous inter
national congresses. Many of them will bo
held in tho Trocadero palace, or in other
buildings of the exposition. Besides minor
gatherings, there will be sixty-nine inter
national congresses under government
patronage. Two of theso aro exclusively
general topic of women's political, social and
industrial rights, and one with woman's
work in organized charity and education.
Other international congresses will be of
bakers, of pigeon fanciers of talk, lore
students, of pyschologist, eleven relating to
medical and sanitary questions and ton
dealing with economics. Tho first of all
will bo tho peace congress, on June 1.
French exhibitors occupy, of courso, the
bulk of the space. Tho United States has
somo 100,000 square feet. Of the entire 30,
000 exhibitors 1,400 coma from America.
Mexicoand tho Central and South Amorlcan
republics, Hnyti, Norway, Switzerland,
Greece, Monaco, Sorvia, Morocco, Japan,
Persia, Slam, Victoria, New Zealand and tho
South African republic participate officially.
Tho only European countries holding thorn
solves entirely aloof are Germany, Sweden,
Denmark, Turkey and Montenegro. Several
of the private committees of countries not
officially represented have received liboral
subsidies from their governments.</text>

LAST OF THE "LONG HORNS.
Texan Stockman's Unique Contribution
to the Paris Exposition.
Unique among the exhibits at the
Paris Exposition will be the contribu
tion of a Texas stockman, J. M: Doble,
of Ramires, Live Oak County. His
curiosity Is the celebrated Dobie steer,
than which there will be no exhibit
more remarkable and yet so character
istic of the Lone Star State.
The Dobie steer is known through
out South and West Texas. He is the
rough and graphic standard of meas
urement of the West Texas stockman.
FAMOUS DOBIE
"Big as the Doble steer" is the hyper
bole they use when describing a pair
of horns. It Is a hyperbole, for travel
the wide plains over and another steer
with a pair of horns such as has the
Doble steer cannot be found. He Is
the last of the old tribe of monster
horned cattle of the plains that gave
to Texas its additional nickname of
"'The Long Horn State." The steer
measures 15 hands and weighs be
tween 1,(500 and 1,700 pounds. His
enormous horns from point to point
measure nine feet seven Inches. The
horns could easily be made to measure
over 10 feet if taken ptt the steer,
steamed, and straightened. When the
steer Is standing in a natural position
on level ground the tip ends of his
horns are fully six feet above the
ground.
Time was, fifteen or less years ngo,
when the long horns were no curiosity
in Texas, but to-day there are few re
minders of the grand old herds that
have been so closely Interwoven with
the history of the State. The steer In
Tarls will excite the wonder and com
mand the admiration of all visitors to
the world's great show.
PE NETRATED SHREWD DISGUISE.
Prison Guard Was Interested in a Mov
intc Grass Plot.
Green Casey, a convict at San Quen
tln, has won the admiration of all bis
fellow convicts at the prison for the
novel contrivance he baa Invented In
order to make his escape rom the pris
on walls some time ago, and through
Sheriff Langdon of Santa Clara County
the story has leaked out.
Casey was a kind of trusty around
the prison grounds, and while working
In one of the grounds in the vicinity of
the prison he took It Into his head that
he would like to escape, and was be
ginning to tax his mind as to the most
advantageous way to suit his purpose.
As he was strolling around on the green
grass which grows In abuudance around
the prison an Idea struck him that if
he could Imitate the grass by some
means he could elude the watchful sen
tries and make good his escape.
Through the aid of his convict friends
be procured some pieces of burlap, and
with the aid of some rope made them
Into a long coat that would cover him
completely when lying on the grass.
He "" i town wheat from the

prison stable and sowed It on the first
layer of ills coat. He cast It down
carelessly at one end of the prison
grounds, and watered it dally. In a
few weeks the grass grew up through
the sack coat, and before a great while
the piece of burlap was conformed into
a grassy lawn.
He was now ready to carry out his
plans, and patiently waited an oppor
tunity. At last he succeeded in getting
his new contrivance across to the north
west of the prison, and in a few min
utes was under his grassy coat.
Slowly he crept along with the clever
ness of a worm, and from all appear-

ances success would crown his efforts.
But his progress was too rapid and
very soon he heard footsteps coming
In his direction. The moving grass plot
which was slowly making its way up
the hillside soon came to a sudden
standstill as the eye of a guard had no
ticed the grass moving and came to In
vestigate the phenomenon. A kick In
the ribs apprised Casey that his plan
had been discovered. The guard took

are melting the last fall of snow,
And soon the bluebirds will be sinking,

The gentleman with the lone gallus, who
down the corn-row slowly plods,
With n right-and-left whacking and

The lee has gone out of the streamlet,
and green leaves peep forth on the
trees;
The worm-fence Is patched up in places,
and new "gums" are placed for the
bees;
The spring house has been fumigated, and
bed clothes are aired on the line,
And the whole farm breathes out a warm
welcome for the coming of spring's
blessed time.
The colt is turned loose in the pasture,
painted over with rank kerosene;
The anvil rings out Its wild clamor as

For spring is nt hand, rousing up this old

BARB-WIRE TELEPHONE LINE.
Three Towns in Indiana Connected by
Using Ordinary Fence Wires.
One of the most novel telephone sys
tems lu the world Is the "barb-wire"
line, which connects the Indiana towns
of Anderson, Fendleton and Ingalls. It
is fifteen miles in length. Its Inventor,
builder and sole owner, Cusslus Alley
of Pendleton, now has six subscribers
at $50 a year each. The time Is not far
distance when there will be tenfold this
number. One clothing company nt An
derson, with branch stores at Pendle
ton, and the Wagner glass works, with
offices nt Anderson and factory at In
galls are using this barb-wire system lu
their business affairs exclusively. They
use the line frequently. They can con
vert It Into a private line by plugs so
arranged that when one party Is using
the line he can cut out all others ex
cept in Mr. Alley's residence, which Is
used as a central station. Ordinary
phones are used with no special
strength of battery and there is very
little trouble with the lines.
In constructing the line, Mr. Alley
used the top strand of the barb-wire
fence of the Big Four railroad, making
the connections with the offices of his
subscribers with ordinary telephone
wire. In some Instances where the
posts hnd rotted It was necessary to
paint the wire and posts with rubber
paint to Insulate the wire. This Is fairly
satisfactory and puts the line in shape
to be used as well In wet weather as at
any other time. The inventor expects
to put In a newly Invented form of glass
Insulator, which Is very cheap and the
only one yet found that can be used on
a fence wire line.
On this line, wagon roads are crossed
thirty-seven times and railroads six
times. At these crossings the line Is
either carried through a gas-pipe con
duit, with Insulated wire or by building
bridges, which Is done by merely nail
ing a piece of timber fifteen feet long
to the last fence post nnd extending

high enough to allow clearance for traf
fic. The whole line of fifteen miles was
built at a cost of about $100, and the
outfit for each house, consisting of re
ceiver, transmitter, battery, call, etc.,
costs not over $10. The magnet bell
call is used.
This barb-wire line Is connected with
the Independent long-distance tele
tnnce telephone line nt Ingalls, and In
this way Indianapolis nnd Greenfield
may be reached by the users of Mr.
Alley's system.
The line has been In operation since
December nnd has not been out of or
der except for a few hours, when a
fast train on the railroad struck a cow,
threw her body against a fence and
broke the wire. A telephone communi
cation, by this simple method. Is placed
within the reach of every community.

residences are supplied with a Binall
instrument at a very small cost. This

Orang-Outang vs. Bur lar.
Some two years ago a retired officer
of the merchant service, living in thq1
Kue d'Alesia, Taris, M. Duchesne,)
brought home an orang-outang from
Borneo. Since growing to its full sizu
the brute Is a terror to the neighbors.
Its muster won't hear of its being
chained up, contenting himself with
shutting the animal in his bed room
before going out. This was done yes
terday, but unfortunately for him,
Nicolas Bargeve, alias "The Devourer,"
had determined to make u professional
call at M. Duchesne's apartment with
intent to burgle. Now ns this Illustri
ous character had only been three days
nt large after completing his ninth term
of Imprisonment, he was naturally un
aware that such a pet as the orang
outang was tolerated In these particu
lar rooms. Consequently, when the
burglar was suddenly pounced upon by
two hairy paws, he was somewhat sur
prised, nud his serenms soon brought
help, with the result that Mr. Bargevo
was drawn out of the room by his feet,
In a very Iguomiulous fashion. He was
taken to the Infirmary, nnd it Is report
ed that he has gone mad and now im
agines himself to have been chauged
Into an ape. Loudon Post.
Soda Water to Appease Hunger.
Soda water Is now prescribed as a
palliative for hunger, especially for the
abnormal hunger produced by disease.
The seat of hunger is found In the solar
plexus. By the use of water charged
with carbonic acid gas the branches of
the solnr plexus distributed through the
mucous membrane of the Htomnch are
Influenced In such a way that the ab-
normal Irritation of the plexus, w hich

Artificial Willow.
One of the curiosities nt Chatsworth,
the Duke of Devonshire's place, Is a
weeping willow made. of copper, nnd so
dexterously fashioned that nt a dis
tance It resembles a real tree. It Is
actually a shower bath, for by pressing
a secret tap, a tiny spray of water
can be made to burst from every
branch nnd twig of (he tree, to the dis
comfort of any who may be under It.

The World's lair in 1900.
Already the air is' filled with rumors
respecting the exposition of 1900, says
a Paris letter in the Philadelphia Tel
graph. Already are the moans of the
Parisians rending the air beforehand,
for it is a Parisian peculiarity to detest
world's fairs in general, and those held
in their own city in particular. Quoth
a miserable native in heartrending ac
cents: "Whenever there is a great ex
hibition all our taxes go up-rtempo-rarily
we are told, but never by an ac
cident do they go down. I paid three
hundred and eighty francs in '77,
and for the same premises my taxes
are now three thousand and odd. We
are overrun by tourists; we are crowd
ed out of all the theaters; the cabmen
all go on strike; the cafes all put up
their prices. For several years before
all the streets one wants to go through
are closed to the public because the ex
hibition is being prepared, and for at
least a year after the same streets are
closed because the exhibition is being
demolished. All your country cousins
come to town and expect to stay with
you in an apartment you have always
found too cramped for the require
ments of yonr own family; and if I am
not lucky enough to be dead I shall
certainly move away before this large
misfortune falls upon this unhappy
place."
tj Happily all Paris is not so pessi
mistic as my friend, and the architects
are busy with their plans. All the
ground comprised in the exhibition of
'89 is to be included, as well as the por
tion of Cour la Heine that will inclose
the Palais 1' Industrie and its surround
ing gardens. We are to have an addi
tional bridge across the Seine which
will open a vista from the Place de la
Concorde straight through to the palace
of electricity, which is to be the cen
tral feature. Our rulers are greatly
bored about the Eiffel tower; but as
the concession was granted for twenty
years it has got to stand; but the arch
itects say consolingly that the 7 will
try and hide it as much as possible.
The sight of it vexes poetio souls,
and Francois Coppee, the author, who
is, by way of being, sthetio, wrote
a formal protest to the government at
the time of its erection to request that
the plan should not be carried out on
the ground that the Eiffel tower, being
ugly and ungainly, and furthermore
being visible from his windows, inter
fered with his flow of inspiration.
However, the tower was built never
theless, and, although we are deadly
tired of seeing it about, Coppee con
tinues to write, so evidently his flow
ol inspiration was only impeded and
not permanently plugged up. Further
more, we are to have a branch exhibit
at Versailles, which will rouse that
sleepy little town from its chief ou
pation of listening to the grass grow
ing in the streets. In the splendid
park of Versailles, on either side of
the grand canal, is to be the retro
spective history of gardens throughout
the ages.
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon,
that were counted among the wonders
of the world, are to be reproduced in
miniature; Japanese gardens, Persian
gardens, the Italian garden of the
renaissance and French and English
gardens of different epochs. The
Grand canal itself is to be used for the
exhibition of one of the floating gar
dens cultivated by the Aztecs in Mex
ico before the Spanish conquest of the
country. The center of the canal is to
be occupied by a large island built on
piles, with bridges connecting it with
the two shores, which is to have
aquaria, grottoes and cascades, with
cages for aquatic birds, and the great
sheet of water is to be additionally or
namented, by an exact reproduction of
the little fleet of elegant boats that
Louis XIV. launched on its surface
when Versailles was first built All
this sounds most imposing; but we are
devoutly thankful that the time for it
has not yet come. It is like the 6tory
of the philosopher who was to teach
the king's donkey to speak in a year's
time, on pain of death, and never
bothered about the penalty on the
crowd tMt the kin? mLrht UJ
the "doSkey "might' die, or ha
himself might die, and whatever hap
pened he had a year to the good. So,
as we have seven years before us, we
do not yet as a rule wail about future
contingencies.</text>

	<text>A LADDER FROM THE CLOUDS
Bach Will Be the Appearance of the
Eiffel Tower of Parts When
Painted.
The Eiffel tower, say the gentlemen
of esthetic temperament, must go.
The Eiffel tower, say the gentlemen
who know the law, must stay for some
years yet. The Eiffel tower, say the
esthetes. Is ugly, discouraging to the
eye and an all-round nightmare. "Scaf
fold I cries the carper. "Down with it !
It has no place in esthetic Paris,"
"Impossible! " objects the law. "When
the company took a lease of it they
got it for a term of 20 years.. You
can't break the lease, and the time is
nowhere up.
"But, urges the esthete, "look at
the shape, look at the size, look at the
color! Is not the whole thing hideous"?
If we can't destroy it we can at least
improve it and lessen the offense to
our senses."
And so the Eiffel tower is going to be
metamorphosed. It has. been in color
a reddish brown, and it is the color to
which the gentlemen with the fine ideas
have long objected. They have called
the tower a shameless creation and re
peatedly ridiculed the commonplace
tone of hue. And now they have pre
v ailed, and the lower is going to be a
thing of beauty, so far as that goes.
Silver white is the color agreed upon,
and it is urged that when the army of
workmen have finished their painting
the huge structure will look really not
so bad after all. Ilalf a hundred men
will be employed on the building, work
ing hard every day for two months.
And 50,000 kilogrammes of paint will
be used up before the Eiffel tower has
finally lost its brickdust coat and finds
itself arrayed in the poetic covering
which the esthetes have advised. Two
coats of paint will be applied and the
brushes will be busy.
It has been objected that the tbwer
has always had the appearance or hav
ing been cast up in inartistic form by
a careless earth. The tower has seemed
to rise awkwardly from the ground,
the critical have said. Why not give
it such an arrangement as would sug
gest the idea of dropping from the
clouds? That would be a pleasing fan
cy, and if the huge tower were lighted
at regular intervals it would present a
picture as of a brilliant creature of the
clouds, and all the world would be lost
in admiration. These plans were sug
gested when the exposition of 1900 were
tinder discussion, and they have been
adopted. A ladder from the clouds.
That was tbe idea. 'And with that the
esthetic taste, was forced to be sat
isfied. .
The Eiffel tower has long been the
universal bed lamp of Paris. The great
candle in the top would be sadly miss-d,
even by those who have fought agair.&t
the continuance of the structure. That
ever-swaying lantern is one of the won
ders of the French capital. Y. Her

THE CAFE PROCOPE TO DISAPPEAR.
Paris correspondence of The London Telegraph.
One of the oldest and also of the most famous
cafes in Paris is about to disappear. The doors
of the Caf4 Procope, situated in the Hue tie
I'Andtnne Oomedie, have been closed. This
celebrated establishment was founded in the
eighteenth century by an Italian named Pro
copio Cutelli. It was in the old days assidu
ously frequented by Diderot. Fontenelle. Jean
Jacques Kousseau and Voltaire, and during the
reizn of Napoleon 111 it was a resort of Gambetta
Jules Kerry. Floquet and Spuller. At a more recent
date the poet Verlaine almost made his habitation
within its walls. The fact that all these, as well
as many other literary and political ceU brities. had
spent many an hour there had shed a sort of
halo over the place, and not a few her worship
pers found time, even during a brief visit to Pari
to undertake a pilgrimage to the quiet spot where
so many great men had foregathered and had
discussed the questions of their day over a cup
of coffee or a bork of b'-er. All things come to an
end, and so has the Cafe Procope, although about
seven years afro it was taken ovr by an en
thusiast who st'f:nt much if his leisure time in
looking up old documents and in questioning ven
erable inhabitants of the quarter with a view to the
compilation of a veritable history of wna.t be
nclit^y regarded a* quite a cUsaic »pou
THE MERCHANT MARINE.
INTERESTING EXHIBITIONS BY TUE
NAVAL POWEBS OF VESSELS
OF PEACE.
Paris, May 12.— From the Creusot build
ing of Messrs. Schneider the visitor pr
to a most interesting comparative exhibition of
the mercantile marine of France, Russia, Ger
many, the United Btates, Great Britain and
ItaJy. Here arc found und^r Class 33 yachts,
machines, designs and models. Inventions for
submarine navigation, submersible boats and
apparatus and appliances of the greatest inter
est, comprising remarkable inventions for sav
ing life at sea. Everything in this pavilion de
serves careful examination. On the first floor
are the exhibits of Italy, England, Holland,
Austria and Spain.

The Messageries Maritimes is, of course, es
sentially French in every feature. Everything
exhibited therein is stamped with the national
gonius and marks the history of the company.
There are seen the Pericles, built in 1851, one of
the fastest vessels in the Levant in its day: the
Hoogly, in the Japan trade about ISO", and the
modern types like the Ann am and La Plata.
Beautiful models of La Lorraine, recently
launched at Saint Nazaire; the packets He de la
RC-union and Madagascar, and the tine steamers
Russia and Aquitaine, of the Society of Mari
time Transports. A pretty clipper steel sailing
vessel should be noted — a four-master of elegant
-
Crossing to the foreign sections, the Austrian
Lloyds shows some of its finest specimens in the
Trieste- and the Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand,
with their Egyptian mail boat, the Hapsburg.
An idea of the power and prosperity of this com
pany may be trained from an examination of the
drawings of the ISO boats constructed since the
creation of the company, from the Arciduca
Ludovico, built in IS>G, to the Styria, launched
only this year.
There are the Faxon, of the L'nion Castle Line,
which does the voyage from Southampton to
Cape Town in eighteen days; the Lucania, one
of the greyhounds of the Cunard Line, and the
two Oceanics of the White Star Line, that of
IS7O, which was a giant in its day, and that of
ISO'J, some G'JO feet long, the biggest passenger
steamer afloat.
Russia, exhibits some very curious types of
ships for special navigation; the fine river
steamer Ekaterimbnurg, and the Biela, pprctall/
built for transporting wood and to be used fcj
one voyage i nly.
In the American section are found the famous
ships of the American Line, the steamers run
ning between Cherbourg, Southampton and
New- York— the St. Louis, the St. Paul! the Pari3
and the New-York— which were armed as aux
iliary cruisers during the recent war, and the
modern type of mixed steamer for freight and
passengers, the Waderland, of the International
Navigation Company.
AT THE FEET OF THE TOWER.
FOREIGN PAVILIONS CLUSTERED AWAY
FROM THE BUB DBS NATIONS.
Round about the hus^ ff>.-tf f> .-t of the EfTei Tower
will be found the pavilions of I antrtefl
which lid not find a place in the Rue dcs Xa
tions—the Swiss chalet, built completely of wood,
surrounded with balconies and terraces, like the
great Alpine chalets. It is not an official pa
vilion for receptions, but a meeting place for
the Swiss visiting Paris; the pavilion of San
Marino, the little republic dovetailed into the
kingdom of Italy, containing cereals, wine, oil,
honey, lace, embroidery, pictures, furniture, uni
forms and various works of art highly creditable
to a country of only five thousand inhabitants;
the pavilion of Siam adds its Oriental stamp to
the peculiar architectural icedoin< Morocco
is divided into two distinct arts the Imperial
Pavilion and the annexes, containing restau
rant, cafes and shops. The Imperial Pavilion is
a reproduction of one of the imperial kiosks of
the ancient Fez palaces, erected by the side of a
Tetuan minaret. Picturesque paintings in warm
colors impart lite an African Orientalism to
the general quaintness of the buildings. Then
near the Woman - Palace is the Pavilion of the
Equator, a two storied building in Louis XV
style. A tower surmounted by a cupola crowns
the edifice, the whole of which, after the fair is
over, will be taken down and sent to Guayaquil
to serve as the town library. The interior, fur
nished with Louis XV furniture, contains the
chief products of the Republic of the Equator,
such as fruits cacao, coffee, rubber, sarsaparil
las, quinine, tobacco, vegetable ivory minerals
and splendid woods; sugar, carpets, stuffs, lace,
embroidery, palm fibre, and the plaited straw
hats so well known as Panama hats.
Among the many constructions clustered here
mention must be made of the French Alpine
Club, containing botanical and geological collec
tions and exhibits of the best mountaineering
necessaries, besides a panorama of the Alps and
excellent photographs of the scenery; the Auto
mobile Club; the Touring Club, open to all its
members; the Chateau Tyrolian; a pavilion for
exhibits of Russian alcohols; one for the history
of ceramic art; branch buildings for business
purposes of the three great banking establish
ments — Credit Lyonnais Society Generate and
Comptoir d'Escompte — and several high priced
and fashionable restaurants</text>

THE Eiffel Tower must come down.
The authorities of Paris have so decreed.
This iron spire, the tallest structure in the
world, and the engineering feat of the last cen
tury, \.i regarded as a dangerous plaything.
When a high wind blows from the south the great
ribbed structure trembles like a frightened horse.
But let a stiff breeze come bowling down from the
north and the tower vibrates until the china rattles in
the cafes, and to those in the observatory at the apex the
sensation is that of a ship fossed by heavy seas.
The fact that the tower is more'sensitive to a wind
from the north than from the south is regarded as proof
of the structural weakness, and from this springs the
theory of danger of collapse.
It is almost twenty years since Gustav Eiffel began
the work of building his sky-scraper. The mark of com
pletion was set for 1889, Exposition year, and on March 31
of that year the tower was thrown open to the public. It
wa« the leading attraction of the big show, and it has
not since ceased to attract attention and coin.
The cost of building the structure was more than
$1,000,000. Of that amount the French government appro
priated $29L',000. Eiffel supplied the remainder, trusting
for his reimbursement to the receipts from admission fees
and other sources.
In this he was not uisappolnted, as the profits of the
first year were almost sufficient to make him whole.
The lease held by Eiffel will expire in next March, and
then, if the present plans of the city fathers are realized,
the work of razing the unique structure will be started.
The plan is to sell the tower to the highest bidder, the
purchaser to be given a certain time in which to remove
what Paris regards as almost a public menace.
Except as a curio and an Investment for its builder,
the tower has been somewhat of a failure.
Much was expected in the scientific world from the
metaphorical observatory, with its physical and biological
laboratories, all 954 feet above ground. But little has
come of this, the enterprise having taken on a rather
commercial aspect.
The Eiffel Tower will ever be considered a colossa*
feat of engineering.</text>

DANGERO1
NEW COATS FOR
The Trocadero m Seen Through the
"Lege" of the Tower.
Height of the Great Tower
as Compared to Some of
the World's Tallest
Structures.
Special Correspondence of The Star.
PARIS, May A, 1907.
A painter has Just fallen from the Eiffel
Tower. Four more men must fall to make
the awful average of the most dangerous
painting Job in the world?repeated every
six years only.
They are repainting the Eiffel Tower,
and all Paris is concerned about the color,
on which depends whether the gigantic
mass of iron shall be the eyesore or the
glory of the capital.
Its first shade was "dead leaf," In 1889.
When the sun lit it up to hazy golden with
an unreal effect of Jeweler's fragility, even
the artists who now corse it admitted that
the Eiffel Tower had its nobility.
In 1896, after immense discussion, they
repainted It orange, magnetic currents
even more than light and weather having
turned it to a dingy chocolate, heavy and
obtrusive. In strong sun the orange
showed gleaming copper or red gold. Oscar
Wilde declared It magnificent. Puvis de
Chavannes threatened to blow It up with
dynamite. From this period dated the bad
name the tower acquired as a colossal
piece of engineering vulgarity, usurping
the artistic note of Paris.
Then, for the exposition, they painted it
"sun color." In bright lights the tower
became a thing of glory once again.
"All Depends Upon the Faint."
"All depends upon the paint!" declares
the city's architect, Bouyard, "a fact
which shows the utter inartistic character
of the Titan 1^3 intruder. The pyramids ol
Egypt were originally cased with gleaming
marble; but its present lack does not
detract from the artistic appropriateness
of the pyramids to their situation!"
The tower gleamed sun color seven years
agoi But the atmospheric electricity received
every hour since then by such an
unprecedented mass of iron reaching into
the air so high is Incalculable. Conducting
tubes a foot and a half in diameter
lead it down the four niles to flftv feet be
low the water-bearing stratum; but the
effect on the paint la there for every one
to see. It does not crack the paint off.
The paint simply disappears, leaving the
ugly chocolate, the dingy brown of the
oxidising iron.
It Is the tower's way of "calling for new
victims. Fifty painters, working continuously
together, take three months to do a
ingle coat Few tourists realise- the immense
proportions of the tower, but
Parisian!, by experience, show you a peculiar
phenomenon of Its deceptive symmetry.
They take you In a cab close to the
tower. It looks heavy and chunky. It
seems sinking into the earth from lU
weight. Half a mile distant from that
oab the tower grows higher and slenderer.
It seems to lift Itself from the earth, like
a person rising from his knees. "Why, It's
bigger than before!" you say. At a mil*
distant-It seems quite as near. The river
boats ttmt flit beside It now look tiny. The
buildings round about are growing small.
But the tower grows! Then at two miles? .
from the heights above Passy?It appears
A 4kin? A# litfhtnMa hl<rVtAT> alAn^nrAf
Efc IIIIUB Vi u fc?v? gutiUVBWi ?and
more open In Its lacework than when
you gaped at its foot almost disappointed!
In a country town thirty miles from
Paris I have sat at night and watched Its
leaxchltsht!
Some Comparisons.

The reault was five men killed In 1900.
Now, last Friday, there fell the first victim
of the series of 1007, though the actual

of foreman, climbing about, looking over
the upper, more dangerous points. He fell
from a point a trifle below the third plat

his fall slightly; yet his body sank almost
five feet into the earth of a flower bed* r

	<text>TOWER T0_BE SAVED
Huge Eiffel Structure Converted
into Wireless Station.
From its Top Messages Are Sent
5,000 MilesSoon to Be in
Touch With the United
States.
Paris.From the summit of the Eif
fel tower, 984 feet in the air, scien
tists communicate with ships nearly
5,000 miles out at sea. It is radio-tel
egraphy which makes it possible to
transmit to all vessels within that dis
tance a given time, say the hour of
noon, mathematically exact within the
tenth of a second, the speed of the
Hertzian waves being almost equal to
that of light.
Put in possession of the chronomet
ric time, the sailor determines the ex
act spot where the ship is at that
moment. He calculates the longitude
and the latitude with absolute correct
ness. The importance of this exacti
tude lies in the fact that it allows of
the correction of serious errors. The
best marine chronometers in use are
subject, after a few weeks or months
of navigation, to variations of two or
three seconds or more, and each error
of a second in time corresponds to
the exact position of the ship. A
metre is slightly more than a yard.
The method now used at the Eiffel
tower was first experimented with last
June. An increase in the power of
electric batteries and improvements
in other instruments enabled radio
telegraphic signals to be sent and re
ceived.
Certain wireless telegraph stations
In the United States, which have water
power at their disposal and are thus
able to produce larger quantities of
electric energy, had already sent elec
tric waves as far as Europe, where
they were registered by sensitive ap
paratus.
In transmitting the hour to ships at
sea the co-operation of the Paris ob
servatory is, of course, required. In
the silent observatory are the two
principal clocks regulated to the hun
dredth of a second, which were order
ed by Baillard, the director of the ob
servatory, from Leroy, the chronome
ter maker of the French navy. These
two clocks twice every dayat 11

o'clock in the morning and at midnight
will signal the time to the four
points of the compass by means of an
electrical apparatus on the summit of
the Eiffel tower.
Exactly at 10:59 o'clock in the morn
ing and at 11:59 at night the astrono
mer on duty, with one eye on the tel
escope, watches the hand of the clock
and sends th fir,st electric signals to
the wireless telegraph station near the
tower. From there, immediately trans
mitted by radio-telegraphy, they travel
immense distances, warning naviga
tors and other wireless stations.
Then, exactly at the hour, and twice
again at intervals of two minutes, the
clockwork automatically establishes a
contact, by means of which an elec
tric manipulator in the Eiffel tower
sets up a discharge of Hertzian waves.
These waves, spreading through space,
reach the limits of the immense cir
cle of which the tower is the center,
influencing all the receivers 4n this
area and conveying to all, as it were,
the beat of a heart which is felt in the
pulsations of the remotest arteries.
In the wireless telegraphy station,
100 yards away in the Champs-de
Mars, the military authorities hold
sway. The station keeps Paris in
touch with the frontier, and even with
remote posts in Afrfca. It was the
great services rendered by wireless
telegraphy during the French expedi
tion to Morocco which led to the pro
vision of modern quarters to the wire
less telegraph corps in Paris.
These quarters are underground and
it is there that the engineer officers
and sergeants carry on. their experi
ments daily. On one door may be
read the impressive words "Danger to
life." The door leads to the first bat
tery, which has been in operation sev
eral years and gives upwards of 50,-
000 volts and a range of 2,500 kilome
tres.
And so the permanency of the Eiffel
tower is assured. Several times moves
have threatened to rid the city of a
monument which many regard as un
asthetic and cumbrous. As to wheth.

Great Eiffel Tewer In Paris Ha 8ted
Tett ( Mere Than a Quarter
Century.
Ai! the Eiffel tower approaches the
twenty-fifth anniversary of its con
struction, Parisians are reminded of
the storm of abuso that broke whert
the tower was first proposed.
"To realize what wo arc planning

only to imagine a tower vertiginous

a black and gigantic factory chim

nightmare 1 And for 20 years we
shall see stretched out over the whole
city, still bright with the genius of so

Nothing more damning was ever
written, even of the Cubists. Yet
the Eiffel tower has long ood as
one of the most attractive units iii all
of the civic architecture of Paris.

Already it has withstood the winds
of 24 winters. How much

BUILDER. Dr. Eiffel also had to protect it TOURISTS: Gl's use the Tower as a background for souvenir photos, enjoy its nightclub
the Tower at the rate of about three a day.
Monsieur Marc, the nearest thing to a per
manent tenant in the Tower's history, yields
to no such yearning for high places. Despite
the unprecedented view topside (the Tower
is only 62 feet shorter than Manhattan's
Chrysler Building), he prefers to conduct his
business in a cramped building near the base
of the structure.
Here, in a musty office, he holds forth
against critical American friends who say the
Eiffel Tower is just an ornament of no earthly
use to mankind. He replies with a long list
of great experiments and moments of signifi
cant utility.
Nor·* Become· Guinea Pig
Τ HERE was, for instance, a time about 40
years ago when an eminent physician herded
his nurse up the stairs of the Tower, taking
her pulse and counting her red corpuscles after
every 400-odd steps. The doctor took the ele
vator and waited for his guinea pig at each
landing. By the time the haggard nurse stag
gered to the top, she was too mad to submit to
further corpuscle counts, and to this day it is
not known how many ol the little red cells
she still had in her.
Another seeker of truth used the Eiffel
to conduct tests to determine what kind of
microbes lived at what altitudes. It was found
that an unusual number of very bad microbes
live at all altitudes. In other words, the Eiffel
Tower has helped science to formulate the
theory that microbes do not get dizzy.
The next milepost came the day a Mont
martre daredevil bounced down 658 of the
Tower's steps on a bicycle without dismount
ing. M. Marc does not say what this proved.
The brochure on the Tower, written by
Monsieur Marc, enumerates several other
uses: for instance, "the races at both Auteuil
and Longchamps can be witnessed from the
top."
And for year·* Citroen, the French
Ford, has rented one side of the Tower
for an illuminated sign that radiates the
time and temperature to nocturnal
Paris.
Fears that the great monument might col
lapse like the One Horse Shay are groundless,
says the man responsible for seeing that its
2,500.000 rivets hold its 16,000,000 pounds of
steel in place. I inquired whether the deli
cately-poised engineering triumph of the last
century was given a regular checkup to dis
cover weak points and signs of decay. Yes,
very regular checks.
"The last one was rather recent," M. Marc
recalled. "Let's see — oh yes, we gave it a
thorough examination back in nineteen
eleven.
"That's the year I took over my près
ent job. We expect the Tower to last a hun
dred years more. The next examination should
be taking place in another quarter of a cen
tury."
Among his unhappier memories as major
domo of one of the world's greatest tourist
"musts" was the visit of Hirohito, then a 21
year-old prince, to the top of the Tower. The
Rising Sun had been invited down from the
Heavens by Gustave Eiffel, himself.
Hirohito Grab* Chair
"Monsieur Eiffel was ninety years old at
the time. In fact, he died a year later, in
nineteen twenty-three," Marc recalls. "He
could hardly stand up, so I placed a nice,
comfortable easy chair in the elevator so he
could sit down when he escorted the young
prince to the top of the Tower. But when that
young snip, Hirohito, entered the lift, he
made a beeline for the chair and poor Mon
sieur Eiffel had to stand all the way up."
Monsieur Marc has never cared much for
Hirohito since then.
When the Germans came to Paris, they
tried to anschluss the Eiffel. "They could
requisition it, but they couldn't make me give
them elevator service," says Etienne Marc
with fervor. And they never did.
"We never took a German up in an ele
vator during the whole occupation. I told the
Military Governor of Paris that I couldn't
take responsibility for accidents if German
soldiers used the elevators. As a result he for
bade their use.
"One million Boches saw their Paris con
quest from the Eiffel Tower. But I made
them walk up one thousand seven hundred
and ten steps to do it."
The only trouble with this deception was
that Frenchmen employed in the govern
ment radio station also had to walk up, a
45-minute climb, to reach their office every
morning. They never complained. But now
they feel they are the only Frenchmen who
ever had to climb up to the clouds to partici
pate in the Underground Movement.
Hitler and fellow-conquering heroes stopped
off at the Eiffel Tower the day they paid their
respects at Napoleon's Tomb. Adolf wanted
to go up. But Etienne Marc was sorry. The
elevator cables were broken. His Excellency
could walk up. He didn't.
Routine maintenance of Etienne Marc's
premises necessitates a regular staff of 25
Eiffel Tower specialists. Every seven years
me ecructure |{et§ a complete paint job
to protect the steel against its greatest
enemy: rust.
Spreading 70,000 pounds of paint requires
the labor of another 60 men working for six
months.
Monsieur Marc has written learned trea
tises on elevator cables and anti-rust paint,
and his experiments with the latter have been
so successful that no piece of steel has ever
had to be replaced. His theories on elevator
cables must be pretty sound, too, because
during his long tenure of office there has never
been an elevator accident.
Unlike most French monuments, the Eiffel
Tower is not owned by the State, but by the
city of Pans, which entrusts operations and
upkeep to the Société de la Tour Eiffel.
The society was originally formed to finance
construction of the 7,800,000-franc Tower,
which is, as much as anything, a monument
to Gustave Eiffel's persistence. He was a
brilliant engineer, who had built bridges in
Portugal, Indo-China, Bolivia and Hungary.
The idea of a tower for the Paris Fair of 1889
came to him from an abortive effort to raise
a similar structure at the Philadelphia Cen
tennial Exposition of 1876.
For a long while the Paris Tower was con
sidered to be the world's ugliest architectural
duckling. Scores of French politicians, cheered
on by committees of outraged artists, advo
cated its destruction. Eiffel fought the clamor
by offering his masterpiece for early tele
graphic experiments, publicizing their success
to such an extent that the government had
to backtrack on plans for tearing the Tower
down.
Paints Tower Candy Yellow
Its defenders breathed more easily for a
while, but in 1912 Monsieur Marc, obeying
a wild instinct, painted the top of the Tower
and parts of the body a gaudy yellow. This
unleashed a new hue and cry, and a minia
ture French Revolution called the "Protesta
tion des Artistes" almost brought the famer
landmark to its knees. The yellow disappeared
ovemieht.
Today the Tower stands triumphant over
its critics. Under a special grant from the
city of Paris, the Eiffel family, which thickly
populates the Société, retains the right to
exploit the Tower for the next 25 years. It
then reverts to the government.
At present, the Eiffel is requisitioned by
the U. S. Army, which has installed a GI
Nightclub on the first landing and a Signal
Battalion up in peanut heaven. Last winter
the elevators were kaput and the Army radio
men had to take the 45-minute perpendicular
hike to the office every morning. Part of the
outfit stayed up for 10 days at a time rather
than brave the 1,710 steps twice a day. One
man almost transferred out of the outfit be
cause the 40-inch sway at the neck of the
Tower made him seasick.
Incidentally, if you're ever roaming around
Paris some afternoon and you want to know
how the races are coming out at Auteuil or
Longchamps, you can call the top of the Eiffel
Tower by dialing SEGUR 00-03. The End</text>

The Eiffel Tower. :
The Eiffel Tower, the ugly iron struc
ture which is to be one of the toatures of
the Paris Exhibition, has reached o height |
of 600 feet. It is theretore the tallest
building in the world. It has been reserve’
ed for a French engineer to attain &
height never before rouched even by the
builders of the Pyramids. The Great
Pyramid of Gizeh, which has hitherto
been the highest structure in existence,
is only 543 feet in height. The steeples
of Cologne Cathedral reach 501 feet, and
the spire of Antwerp measures 476 feet,
whilst the Strasburg spire reaches 468
feet. The spire of Salisbury Cathedral,
the loftiest in England, is 404 feet high.—
“Its true proportions,” says a London
paper— the Daily News—will be bet
ter realised by reflecting that it is three
times as high as the Monument on Fish
street Hill, and more than soar times as
lofty as the pedestal from which Nel
son’s effizy looks down upon Trafalgar
Square. If we were to place the Duke
of York’s Colnmn on the top of the Mon
ument, and Nelson’s Colomn on the top |
of that, the sum total would be wmore
than a hundred feet below the present
top of M. Eiffel's tower. Itis tobe ho
ped that the Exhibition aunthorities will
find that the game is worth the candle.
The tower will have to attract an enor
mous number of people to the Exhibition
to pay for itself, and when the Exhibi
tion is over what is to become of it?
Except as a metemological station, ‘and:
even trom this point of view its value
is doubttul, it ¢can be put to no practical
purpose.”—lbid..</text>

	<text>SCRIBBLING ON EIFFEL TOWER.
Nkwri, Fun*. Term and Stotlmeau tf
Many Sort* in Many Language*.
Big as the Eiffel tower is. it is too cir
cumscribed for the people who insist
upon writing their names and recording
their impressions on its iron framework.
They have used up all the available
space. All the girders, beams, protection
rails and rivet heads within reach bear
the literary contributions of many thou
sand visitors. The tower is a gigantic
cosmopolitan registry of names. Be
tween 15,000 and 20,000 people ascend it
every day, r.nd most of them consider it
their duty to add to the collection. The
Figaro newspaper keeps a visitors* book
at its printing ofltee on the second floor
to accommodate visitors who have not
the desire or who cannot find the space
to scribble on the ironwork.
The writing left is in as many lan
guages as there are nationalities among
the visitors, but the most interesting
contributions come from the native
French. A Frenchman grows naturally
into the opinion that France is the foun
tain of progress, civilization and every
thing else. Tins opinion remains his
principal article of faith through life—
especially when his life is confined to
France. When he mounts the Eiffel
tower, by means of American elevators,
he is more than ever convinced of the
universal supremacy of France. He
bursts out into uncontrollable fits of pa
triotism.
“Glory to the noble France,” writes
one after his name. “Honor to French
genius," says another. “ Having mounted
the Eiffel tower, I am proud of being
French,” writes M. Masson. “1 will
name my next daughter Eiffeline," says
a Bordeaux engineer. One, M. Gouloux,
apostrophizes thus: ‘French genius,
thou wilt always be the first in the
world!” and a patriotic Marseillais left
this record: “Long live la grand France,
the birthplace of civilization of the en
tire world.”
Some of the visitors drop into poetry,
and perpetrate bad puns at the expense
of the tower. “What height is the tailor
who has forgotten his measure and sits
dowft on the third platform of the tow
er?” ia a common calembour which one
left. The answer, of course, is that he is
sitting sans metre, or at cent (100) metres.
This uext, of the same style, was address
ed to the silk weavers of Lyons: “The
Lyonese may content themselves, for as
often as they ascend the Eiffel tower
they will see all Paris en pas de soie—in
silk stockings, or underneath, as pas de
soie usually are. The punsters, as they
would say, sometimes rise to the situa
tion, but puns and bad poetry are not
improved upon by translation.
M. Sellier, of the Grand Opera, writes:
“I wish that my voice rose as high as the
tower.” Isidor Goldschmidt, a presti
digitateur: “I have found my master
pour les tours" (for tricks), and an Italian
confesses that “at 1,000 feet I can find
nothing to write which would be up to
the situation—Aquello. empego.” A
Dutchman leaves this neat compliment
behind him: “The tower is not so high
as our esteem for France,” and a Span
iard says: “The Tower of Babel separat
ed peoples by the confusion of tongues,
and the Eiffel tower reunites them.”
More than one thinks this very clever: “I
never thought I would occupy such a lofty
position in life.”
Tho tower makes a favorable impres
sion on lovesick Orlandos, who scrawl
sentimental messages to their Rosalinds
whenever they get the chance.
To her who hasn't come.—Paul
Jeannie, ma cherie; from the top of the tower 1
■end thee a kiss.—Alphonse
1 think of*thee, Aden aide.
These are samples of the messages left
They are all written in the second per
ron—the usual French lover's style.
Catholic priests are not above record-
ing their impressions. They write in
Latin.
“O, altitudo!” exclaims the cure of
Villeparlsis, in Seine-et-Marne.
'‘Magnificat anima mea Dominum, ’
says a priest from the Meuse.
Another exdfcls them all with his “Glo
ria in excelsis Deo.”—New York Sun.</text>
